*   FITS header parser routine; fitshdr()
*   -------------------------------------
*   fitshdr() parses a character array containing a FITS header, extracting
*   all keywords and their values into an array of fitskey structs.
*
*   Given:
*      header   const char []
*                        Character array containing the (entire) FITS header,
*                        for example, as might be obtained conveniently via
*                        the CFITSIO routine fits_hdr2str().
*
*                        Each header "card" consists of exactly 80 7-bit ASCII
*                        printing characters in the range 0x20 to 0x7e (which
*                        excludes NUL, BS, TAB, LF, FF and CR) especially
*                        noting that the cards are NOT null-terminated.
*
*      ncards   int      Number of cards in header[].
*      nkeyids  int      Number of entries in keyids[].
*
*   Given and returned:
*      keyids   struct fitskeyid []
*                        While all keywords are extracted from the header,
*                        keyids[] provides a convienient way of indexing them.
*                        The fitskeyid struct contains three members, the
*                        first of which must be set by the user with the
*                        remainder set by fitshdr():
*
*                           char name[12] Name of the required keyword.  This
*                                         is to be set by the caller; the '.'
*                                         character may be used for
*                                         wildcarding.  Trailing blanks will
*                                         be replaced with nulls.
*
*                           int count     The number of matches found for the
*                                         keyword.
*
*                           int idx[2]    Indices into keys[], the array of
*                                         fitskey structs returned by
*                                         fitshdr() (see below).  Note that
*                                         these are 0-relative array indices,
*                                         not card numbers.
*
*                        If the keyword is found in the header the first index
*                        will be set to the array index of its first
*                        occurrence, otherwise it will be set to -1.
*
*                        If multiples of the keyword are found, the second
*                        index will be set to the array index of its last
*                        occurrence, otherwise it will be set to -1.
*
*                        All matched keywords will have their fitskey.cardno
*                        member negated.
*
*   Returned:
*      nreject  int*     Number of header cards rejected for syntax errors.
*      keys     struct fitskey**
*                        Pointer to an array of ncards fitskey structs (see
*                        below) containing all keywords and keyvalues
*                        extracted from the header.
*
*                        Memory for the array is allocated by fitshdr() and
*                        this must be freed by the caller by invoking free()
*                        on the array.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null fitskey pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*
*   Notes
*   -----
*    1) Keyword parsing is done in accordance with the syntax defined by
*       NOST 100-2.0, noting the following points in particular:
*
*       a) Sect. 5.1.2.1 specifies that keywords be left-justified in columns
*          1-8, blank-filled with no embedded spaces, composed only of the
*          ASCII characters ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-_
*
*          fitshdr() accepts any characters in columns 1-8 but flags keywords
*          that do not conform to standard syntax.
*
*       b) Sect. 5.1.2.2 defines the "value indicator" as the characters "= "
*          occurring in columns 9 and 10.  If these are absent then the
*          keyword has no value and columns 9-80 may contain any ASCII text
*          (but see note 2 for CONTINUE cards).  This is copied to the comment
*          member of the fitskey struct.
*
*       c) Sect. 5.1.2.3 states that a keyword may have a null (undefined)
*          value if the value/comment field, columns 11-80, consists entirely
*          of spaces, possibly followed by a comment.
*
*       d) Sect. 5.1.1 states that trailing blanks in a string keyvalue are
*          not significant and the parser always removes them.  A string
*          containing nothing but blanks will be replaced with a single blank.
*
*          Sect. 5.2.1 also states that a quote character (') in a string
*          value is to be represented by two successive quote characters and
*          the parser removes the repeated quote.
*
*       e) The parser recognizes free-format character (NOST 100-2.0,
*          Sect. 5.2.1), integer (Sect. 5.2.3), and floating-point values
*          (Sect. 5.2.4) for all keywords.
*
*       f) Sect. 5.2.3 offers no comment on the size of an integer keyvalue
*          except indirectly in limiting it to 70 digits.  The parser will
*          translates an integer keyvalue to a 32-bit signed integer if it
*          lies in the range -2147483648 to +2147483647, otherwise it
*          interprets it as a 64-bit signed integer if possible, or else a
*          "very long" integer as described below.
*
*       g) "END     " not followed by 72 blanks is not considered to be a
*          legitimate end card.
*
*    2) The parser supports a generalization of the OGIP Long String Keyvalue
*       Convention (v1.0) whereby strings may be continued onto successive
*       header cards.  A card contains a segment of a continued string if and
*       only if
*          a) it contains the pseudo-keyword "CONTINUE",
*          b) columns 9 and 10 are both blank,
*          c) columns 11 to 80 contain what would be considered a valid string
*             keyvalue, including optional inline comment, if column 9 had
*             contained '=',
*          d) the previous card contained either a valid string keyvalue or a
*             valid CONTINUE card.
*       If any of these conditions is violated, the card is considered in
*       isolation.
*
*       Syntax errors in inline comments in a continued string are treated
*       more permissively than usual; the '/' delimiter may be omitted
*       provided that parsing of the string keyvalue is not compromised.
*       However, the FITSHDR_COMMENT status bit will be set for the card (see
*       below).
*
*       As for normal strings, trailing blanks in a continued string are not
*       significant.
*
*       In the OGIP convention "the '&' character is used as the last non-
*       blank character of the string to indicate that the string is
*       (probably) continued on the following keyword".  This additional
*       syntax is not required by fitshdr(), but if '&' does occur as the last
*       non-blank character of a continued string keyvalue then it will be
*       removed, along with any trailing blanks.  However, blanks that occur
*       before the '&' will be preserved.
*
*
*   Keyword/value information
*   -------------------------
*   fitshdr() returns an array of fitskey structs, each of which contains the
*   result of parsing one FITS header card:
*
*      int keyno
*         Card number (1-relative) in the array passed as input to fitshdr().
*         This will be negated if the keyword matched any specified in the
*         keyids[] index.
*
*      int keyid
*         Index into the first entry in keyids[] with which the card matches,
*         else -1.
*
*      int status
*         Status flag bit-vector for the header card employing the following
*         bit masks defined as preprocessor macros:
*
*           FITSHDR_KEYWORD    Illegal keyword syntax.
*           FITSHDR_KEYVALUE   Illegal keyvalue syntax.
*           FITSHDR_COMMENT    Illegal inline comment syntax.
*           FITSHDR_CARD       Illegal card, e.g. an END card with trailing
*                              text.
*           FITSHDR_TRAILER    Card following a valid END card.
*
*        The header card is syntactically correct if no bits are set.
*
*      char keyword[12]
*         Keyword name, is null-filled for keywords of less than eight
*         characters (trailing blanks replaced by nulls).
*
*         Use sprintf(dst, "%.8s", keyword) to copy it to a character array
*         with null-termination, or sprintf(dst, "%8.8s", keyword) to blank-
*         fill to eight characters followed by null-termination.
*
*      int type
*         Keyvalue data type:
*            0: No keyvalue.
*            1: Logical, represented as int.
*            2: 32-bit signed integer.
*            3: 64-bit signed integer (see below).
*            4: Very long integer (see below).
*            5: Floating point (stored as double).
*            6: Integer complex (stored as double[2]).
*            7: Floating point complex (stored as double[2]).
*            8: String.
*            8 + 10*n: Continued string (see note 2 and below).
*
*         A negative type indicates that a syntax error was encountered when
*         attempting to parse a keyvalue of the particular type.
*
*         64-bit signed integer:
*            64-bit signed integers lie in the range
*               -9223372036854775808 <= int64 <  -2147483648
*            or          +2147483647 <  int64 <= +9223372036854775807.
*            A native 64-bit data type may be defined via preprocessor macro
*            WCS_INT64 defined in config.h, e.g. as 'long long int'; this will
*            be typedef'd to 'int64' here.  If WCS_INT64 is not set, then
*            int64 is typedef'd to int[3] instead and the keyvalue is to be
*            computed as
*
*                    ((keyvalue.k[2]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.k[1]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.k[0]
*
*            and may reported via
*
*               if (keyvalue.k[2]) {
*                  printf("%d%09d%09d", keyvalue.k[2], abs(keyvalue.k[1]),
*                                    abs(keyvalue.k[0]));
*               } else {
*                  printf("%d%09d", keyvalue.k[1], abs(keyvalue.k[0]));
*               }
*
*            where keyvalue.k[0] and keyvalue.k[1] range from -999999999 to
*            +999999999.
*
*         Very long integers:
*            Integers up to 70 decimal digits in length are encoded in
*            keyvalue.l as an array of int[8], each of which stores 9 decimal
*            digits.  The keyvalue is to be computed as
*
*               (((((((keyvalue.l[7]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[6]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[5]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[4]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[3]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[2]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[1]) * 1000000000 +
*                      keyvalue.l[0]
*
*         Continued strings:
*            Continued strings are not reconstructed, they remain split over
*            successive fitskey structs in the keys[] array returned by
*            fitshdr().  The keyvalue data type, 8 + 10n, indicates the
*            segment number, n, in the continuation.
*
*      union keyvalue
*         A union containing the keyword value:
*            keyvalue.i (int):       Logical (type == 1), and
*                                    32-bit signed integer (type == 2).
*            keyvalue.k (int64):     64-bit signed integer (type == 3),
*                                    see above.
*            keyvalue.l (int[8]):    Very long integer (type == 4), see above.
*            keyvalue.f (double):    Floating point (type == 5).
*            keyvalue.c (double[2]): Integer and floating point complex
*                                    (type == 6 || 7).
*            keyvalue.s (char[72]):  String (type == 8), null-terminated.
*
*      int ulen
*         Where an inline comment contains a units string in the standard
*         form, e.g. [m/s], the ulen member indicates its length, inclusive of
*         square brackets.  Otherwise ulen is zero.
*
*      char comment[84]
*         Comment associated with the keyword or, for cards rejected because
*         of syntax errors, the compete card itself with null-termination.
*
*         Comments are null-terminated with trailing spaces removed.  Leading
*         spaces are also removed from inline comments (i.e. those immediately
*         following the '/' character), but not from COMMENT or HISTORY cards
*         or cards without a value indicator ("= " in columns 9-80).
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   encoded in the fitshdr_errmsg character array.
