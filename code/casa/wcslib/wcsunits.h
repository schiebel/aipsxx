*   Summary of routines
*   -------------------
*   Routines in this suite deal with units specifications and conversions:
*
*      wcsunits(): given two unit specifications, derive the conversion from
*         one to the other.
*
*      wcsutrn(): translates certain commonly used but non-standard unit
*         strings.  It is intended to be called before wcsulex() which only
*         handles standard FITS units specifications.
*
*      wcsulex(): parses a standard FITS units specification of arbitrary
*         complexity, deriving the conversion to canonical units.
*
*
*   FITS units specification conversion; wcsunits()
*   -----------------------------------------------
*   wcsunits() derives the conversion from one system of units to another.
*
*   Given:
*      have     const char []
*                        FITS units specification to convert from (null-
*                        terminated), with or without surrounding square
*                        brackets (for inline specifications); text following
*                        the closing bracket is ignored.
*
*      want     const char []
*                        FITS units specification to convert to (null-
*                        terminated), with or without surrounding square
*                        brackets (for inline specifications); text following
*                        the closing bracket is ignored.
*
*   Returned:
*      scale    double*  Convert units using (scale*value + offset)^power.
*      offset   double*  Normally offset == 0.0 except for log() or ln()
*      power    double*  conversions, e.g. log(MHz) to ln(Hz).  Likewise,
*                        power == 1.0 except for exp() conversions, e.g.
*                        exp(ms) to exp(/Hz).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                         1-9: (status return from wcsulex(), see below.)
*                          10: Non-conformant unit specifications.
*                          11: Non-conformant functions.
*
*                        scale is zeroed on return if an error occurs.
*
*
*   Translation of non-standard unit specifications; wcsutrn()
*   ----------------------------------------------------------
*   wcsutrn() translates certain commonly used but non-standard unit strings,
*   e.g. "DEG", "MHZ", "KELVIN", that are not recognized by wcsulex().  A full
*   list is given below.  Compounds are also recognized, e.g. "JY/BEAM" and
*   "KM/SEC/SEC".  Extraneous embedded blanks are removed.
*
*   Given:
*      ctrl     int      Although "S" is commonly used to represent seconds,
*                        its translation to "s" is potentially unsafe since
*                        the standard recognizes "S" formally as Siemens,
*                        however rarely that may be used.  The same applies
*                        to "H" for hours (Henry), and "D" for days (Debye).
*                        This bit-flag controls what to do in such cases:
*                           1: Translate "S" to "s".
*                           2: Translate "H" to "h".
*                           4: Translate "D" to "d".
*                        Thus ctrl == 0 doesn't do any unsafe translations,
*                        whereas ctrl == 7 does all of them.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      unitstr  char []  Null-terminated character array containing the units
*                        specification to be translated.
*
*                        Inline units specifications in the comment field of
*                        a FITS header card are also handled.  If the first
*                        non-blank character in unitstr is '[' then the unit
*                        string is delimited by its matching ']'.  Blanks
*                        preceding '[' will be stripped off, but text
*                        following the closing bracket will be preserved
*                        without modification.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                          -1: No change was made, other than stripping blanks
*                              (not an error).
*                           0: Success.
*                          12: Potentially unsafe translation, whether applied
*                              or not (see above).
*
*
*   FITS units specification parser; wcsulex()
*   ------------------------------------------
*   wcsulex() parses a standard FITS units specification of arbitrary
*   complexity, deriving the scale factor required to convert to canonical
*   units - basically SI with degrees and "dimensionless" additions such as
*   byte, pixel and count.
*
*   Given:
*      unitstr  const char []
*                        Null-terminated character array containing the units
*                        specification, with or without surrounding square
*                        brackets (for inline specifications); text following
*                        the closing bracket is ignored.
*
*   Returned:
*      func     int*     Special function type (see Note 4 below)
*                          0: None
*                          1: log()  ...base 10
*                          2: ln()   ...base e
*                          3: exp()
*
*      scale    double*  Scale factor for the unit specification; multiply a
*                        value expressed in the given units by this factor to
*                        convert it to canonical units.
*
*      units    double[WCSUNITS_NTYPE]
*                        A units specification is decomposed into powers of 17
*                        fundamental unit types: angle, mass, length, time,
*                        count, pixel, etc.  Preprocessor macros are defined
*                        below to dimension this vector and access its
*                        elements.
*
*                        Corresponding character strings, wcsunits_types[] and
*                        wcsunits_units[], are predefined to describe each
*                        quantity and its canonical units.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Invalid numeric multiplier.
*                           2: Dangling binary operator.
*                           3: Invalid symbol in INITIAL context.
*                           4: Function in invalid context.
*                           5: Invalid symbol in EXPON context.
*                           6: Unbalanced bracket.
*                           7: Unbalanced parenthesis.
*                           8: Consecutive binary operators.
*                           9: Internal parser error.
*
*                        scale and units[] are zeroed on return if an error
*                        occurs.
*
*
*   Notes
*   -----
*    1) The parser is permissive in accepting whitespace in all contexts in a
*       units specification where it does not create ambiguity (e.g. not
*       between a metric prefix and a basic unit string), including in strings
*       like "log (m ** 2)" which is formally disallowed.
*
*    2) "angstrom" is allowed here in addition to "Angstrom" (OGIP usage).
*       "ohm"      is allowed here in addition to "Ohm"  (OGIP usage).
*       "Byte"     is allowed here in addition to "byte" (common usage).
*
*    3) Table 6 of WCS Paper I lists eleven units for which metric prefixes
*       are allowed.  However, in this implementation only prefixes greater
*       than unity are allowed for "a" (annum), "yr" (year), "pc" (parsec),
*       "bit", and "byte", and only prefixes less than unity are allowed for
*       "mag" (stellar magnitude).
*
*       Metric prefix "P" (peta) is specifically forbidden for "a" (annum) to
*       avoid confusion with "Pa" (Pascal, not peta-annum).  Note that metric
*       prefixes are specifically disallowed for "h" (hour) and "d" (day) so
*       that "ph" (photons) cannot be interpreted as pico-hours, nor "cd"
*       (candela) as centi-days.
*
*    4) Function types log(), ln() and exp() may only occur at the start of
*       the units specification.  The scale and units[] for these refers to
*       the string inside the function "argument", e.g. to "MHz" in log(MHz)
*       for which a scale of 1e6 will be returned.
*
*
*   Translation of non-standard unit specifications
*   -----------------------------------------------
*   Apart from leading and trailing blanks, a case-sensitive match is required
*   for the aliases listed below, in particular the only recognized aliases
*   with metric prefixes are "KM", "KHZ", "MHZ", and "GHZ".  Potentially
*   unsafe translations of "D", "H", and "S", shown in parentheses, are
*   optional.
*

*      V         volt, volts, Volt, Volts, VOLT, VOLTS
*      yr        year, years, YR, YEAR, YEARS
*
*   The aliases "angstrom", "ohm", and "Byte" for (Angstrom, Ohm, and byte)
*   are recognized by wcsulex() itself as an unofficial extension of the
*   standard (see above), but they are converted to the standard form here.
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   encoded in the wcsunits_errmsg character array.
