// \mainpage AIPS++/CASA
//
// AIPS++/CASA is an astronomical data processing system developed by a
// consortium of (radio-)astronomical institutes.
// See the <a href="http://aips2.nrao.edu">AIPS++ pages</a> for more
// information on AIPS++/CASA.
//
// The system consists of a set of layered libraries (packages) which can 
// be seen on Doxygen's Modules page.
// <br>
// Bindings to the libraries have been created for
// <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and
// <a href="http://aips2.nrao.edu/docs/glish/glish.html">Glish</a>.
//
// The main features of AIPS++/CASA are:
// <ul>
//  <li>N-dim functions with auto-differentiation and linear or non-linear
//      fitting.
//  <li>Table data system supporting N-dim arrays with advanced querying.
//  <li>Values with physical units (Quanta) and astronomical reference frames
//      (Measures).
//  <li>MeasurementSets for storing data in the UV-domain.
//  <li>N-dim images in world coordinates with various analysis operations.
// </ul>
