//
// The images package handles N-dimensional images, their masks,
// coordinates, and auxiliary info like history.
// <br> It is possible to use virtual images like:
// <ul>
//  <li> slices of images
//  <li> regions in images
//  <li> expressions of images
//  <li> concatenation of images
// </ul>
//
// It is built on top of the
// <linkto module=lattices>lattices</linkto> module.
