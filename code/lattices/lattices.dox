// \defgroup lattices lattices package (liblattices)
//
// The lattices package is a generalization of n-dimensional 
// <linkto module=Arrays>arrays</linkto>.
// It can hold arrays in memory, on disk, or as a virtual lattice using
// expressions, subsets, masking, etc.
//
// The <linkto module=images>images</linkto> module is built on top of lattices.
