<H2><A NAME="Intro">Introduction</A></H2> 
<P>

This document describes and records the development plan for AIPS++
from March 1995 (when new management of AIPS++ was instituted) until
mid-1996.  The plan will evolve and change with time. Revisions since
the last version are shown in <STRONG>bold</STRONG>. Items subject to 
continuing discussion are given in<i> italics</i>.</p>

With the
exception of this section, which has some general observations, the
style of this document is direct. It says what we will do with
relatively little emphasis on saying why we will do it or who will do
it. <STRONG>This plan is mirrored in the 
<A HREF="targets.html">AIPS++ Target Dates</A> where names and
timescales are given.</STRONG> I have matched the goals here to the manpower
available rather than give a wishlist. I have also described areas
where we will not be active.  </P>

<P> First I give some some general observations that drive the
plan:  
</P>

<UL>
<LI>The goal of AIPS++ is to be the next generation software system for
astronomical data analysis. The strategy to acheive this goal is to follow
three phases:
<ol>
<li> Develop the infrastructure library,
<li> Test and extend the library. We will do this by tightly focussed applications
development. To attract early adopters of AIPS++, we will
preferentially add key, unique applications that do not exist in other packages,
<li> Expand out to completeness.
</ol>
Phase 1 is mostly complete. We are embarking upon the second
phase in which the infrastructure will be tested and extended. This will occur
principally at the two main NRAO sites (Socorro and Charlottesville). Once the
libraries and central design concepts are shown to be robust, applications
development (Phase 3) can accelerate and spread to more AIPS++ sites. 
</LI>
<LI> Adoption of AIPS++ by applications programmers  requires robust, reliable,
well-designed, well-documented libraries.   It would be irresponsible to
develop designs that are not documented. This will a key part of the
AIPS++ intellectual heritage. The completeness of the documentation of
the early design of IRAF serves as a good example.  
</LI>
<LI>I expect that the libraries will change and grow significantly as
applications are written. This requires close communication between
application developers and those responsible for the library. The
distinction between infrastructure and application code is hard to make
at this early stage since most applications should produce code that
will eventually end up in the library.  
</LI>
<LI>To maintain focus and to provide simple feedback concerning the
library, applications development should proceed in a few tightly
focussed areas. These applications will be drawn from single dish support 
(specifically GBT
commissioning and observing), and synthesis support.  Once these applications
have been demonstrated, we expect that further application development will
proceed more rapidly and with the active involvement of other sites.
</LI>
</LI>  
</UL>
<P>AIPS++ is conceptually broken down into various subcomponents:
<A HREF="#Infra">Infrastructure</A>, <A HREF="#System">System</A>, <A HREF="#Doc">Documentation</A>,
<A HREF="#Single">Single Dish Processing</A>,<A HREF="#Synth">Synthesis Processing</A>,
<A HREF="#Image">Image Analysis</A>,<A HREF="#Visual">Visualization</A>,
<A HREF="#Observing">Observing support</A>, and <A HREF="#Manage">Management</A>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Infra">Infrastructure</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Object persistence: A mechanism for allowing object
persistence is required.</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>User Interface: We will continue to use Glish as the CLI. <STRONG>There is
a separate <A HREF="glishdev.html">development plan</A> for Glish.</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Tasking: We will develop further and implement the design for Tasking 
described in Glendenning's <A HREF="../memos/111.ps">memo</a> on the architecture of AIPS++.
As part of this work, the Inputs Classes must be redesigned to support
more complex applications <EM>e.g.</EM> convert input file name to an
image directly. </STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>Graphical User Interface: Paul Shannon will be responsible for the
adoption of an existing GUI or the development of a prototype GUI.
Harvey Liszt and Rick Fisher will advise.  This will be done in partnership
with the GBT Monitor and Control group.
</LI>
<LI>Coordinates: <STRONG>The ATNF group will be responsible for the completion of
the design and implementation of Coordinate and Measure classes.</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>Image Class: The Image class will be integrated with the new
Coordinate and Measure classes. <STRONG> Masks and weights will be added.
</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>Plotting Capabilities: 1-D plotting is needed in some form for the
GBT work. <STRONG>For the GBT Systems integration work, we will use a commercial
widget, Xrt/Graph. We will evaluate alternative, public domain solutions</STRONG>. Paul Shannon
will be responsible for this with advice from Harvey Liszt and Rick Fisher.
</LI>
<LI>Table development: Storage managers and optimization will be the
key to efficient use of the Table system, particularly in the "Big Table"
model of Measurement Sets. This work will be under the supervision of
Ger van Diepen. <STRONG>The key remaining development is of a hypertiled storage
manager.</STRONG>
</LI>  
<LI><STRONG>FITS Classes: The FITS classes will be augmented to support random
access i/o, to avoid the downcasting now required, and to improve the
interface.</STRONG>
</LI>  
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="System">System</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>Code Management System: We will add support for automated testing.
</LI>
<LI>Compiler Support: We will evaluate the beta version of the 
Sun native compiler.  As a second priority, we will also
investigate use of the IBM compiler.
</LI>
</UL>  
<H2><A NAME="Doc">Documentation</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>Overall Documentation: Much of the existing documentation is
out-of-date. We will attempt to update key documentation. We will distinguish
between up-to-date and outdated documentation.  
</LI>
<LI>User Documentation: User documentation is proceeding well under the
direction of Alan Bridle. <STRONG>Decisions
must be made on directory structure and development of tools.</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>Programmer Documentation: <STRONG><i>One person will be given overall responsibility
for programmer documentation and will work in close collaboration with Alan
Bridle to provide a unified approach to user and programmer 
documentation</i></STRONG>.
Design documents must be regarded
as a necessary part of the development of a new class or of a substantial
revision of an exisiting class. For major existing classes, we will write 
<i>post hoc</i> design descriptions. Defunct design documents will be removed 
from active directories.
</LI>  
</UL><H2><A NAME="Single">Single Dish Processing</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>On The Fly Mapping: We will finish the OTFTool developed by Bob
Garwood for the 12m and support it for use at the telescope. However, substantial 
additions or augmentations will take second priority to the GBT support
discussed below.
</LI>
<LI>GBT Commissioning support: AIPS++ will support the GBT systems
integration work on the 140' telescope. This requires filling into an
AIPS++ Table, plotting and some simple manipulations of engineering and
astronomical data, all by July 1995.  
</LI>
<LI>SDCalc: After support for the commissioning of the GBT, we will
start development of a Single Dish Calculator of the sort envisaged by
Harvey Liszt and Rick Fisher. This will require development of a GUI and
plotting capabilities. 
</LI>
<LI>SDImager: After SDCalc, we will develop imaging capabilities for
Single Dish Observing in both spectral line and continuum modes.  These
will be analogous to the advanced imaging capabilities important in
interferometry.
</LI>  
</UL><H2><A NAME="Synth">Synthesis Processing</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>Advanced Imaging: We will
develop tools for advanced imaging using the Briggs NNLS deconvolution
algorithm in conjunction with self-calibration and careful editing of
visibility data.  
</LI>  
<LI>Calibration: We will develop a complete calibration package for the
ATCA.  Calibration for other telescopes is deferred until a workable scheme for
the ATCA has been developed. <STRONG>Calibration for BIMA, VLBA, 
WSRT is tentatively planned to be addressed early 1996.</STRONG>
</LI>
</UL><H2><A NAME="Image">Image Analysis</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>Image Analysis will be deferred until the initial applications in Single Dish and Synthesis
processing are complete.This is likely to be until early 1996.</LI>  
</UL><H2><A NAME="Visual">Visualization</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>Visualization will continue to be developed at BIMA sites. The code will be checked
into the AIPS++ Code Management System. AIPS++ Classes will be used where
possible. A second round of revisions and augmentations to AIPSView will be made
with the goal of supporting the planned applications development (for example,
AIPSView will supporting editing of visibility data)</LI>  
</UL><H2><A NAME=Observing">Observing support</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>The VLBA Observe program (also known as Gnomes) will be ported to AIPS++ starting Fall
1995.</LI>  
</UL><H2><A NAME="Manage">Management</A></H2>  
<UL>
<LI>
This plan is predicated upon the following manpower being available and
dedicated to AIPS++ with high predictability but not necessarily 100%
time allocation.
</LI>
<LI>The AIPS++ group inside NRAO will be composed as follows:  
<UL>
<LI>Socorro: Cornwell (Project Manager), Glendenning (Deputy), Roberts
and two new hires will work on Management, Infrastructure, and
Synthesis Applications. Hjellming is a scientific advisor. I
expect several long-term visitors to be present in Socorro at any time
over the next few years. <STRONG>Mark Wieringa will visit the AOC for
at least 6 months starting in September 1995 to work on ATCA calibration. In Fall 1995, Young will join 
the AIPS++ group. In early 1996, Beasley wil begin work on VLBA calibration
inside AIPS++.</STRONG>
</LI>
<LI>Charlottesville: Garwood, Shannon, and Schiebel will work on Single
Dish and Infrastructure. Bridle is working on User Documentation. Liszt 
is a scientific advisor of Single Dish.  
</LI>
<LI>Green Bank: Payne will support Single Dish. Fisher is a scientific
advisor for Single Dish and Infrastructure.  
</LI>  
<LI><STRONG>Tucson: There is currently no AIPS++ support person at Tucson. Darrel
Emerson is a scientific advisor for Single Dish.</STRONG>
</LI>  
</UL></LI>
<LI>
The AIPS++ group at  ATNF will be: Killeen (Local Manager), Brouw, Calabretta,
and Wieringa.
</LI>
<LI>
The AIPS++ group at BIMA/NCSA will be: Crutcher (Local Manager), Baker, Baxter, Ravlin,
and Pixton.
</LI>
<LI>
The AIPS++ group at NFRA will be: Noordam (Local Manager), van Diepen, and
Olnon.
</LI>
<LI> The other AIPS++ sites (HIA/DRAO, NRAL, NCRA) are expected to provide
substantially less than 1 person each to this plan.
</LI>
<LI>The Project Management will report quarterly to the AIPS++ Board on
progress in the last quarter and plans for the next quarter.  
</LI> 
<LI><STRONG>Plans for AIPS++ development will be described in this document
which will be updated as required.</STRONG>
</LI> 
<LI><STRONG>Tracking of progress in AIPS++ will be via a Target Dates list that
will be updated and distributed to <ADDRESS>aips2-workers</ADDRESS>at the beginning of every week.</STRONG>
