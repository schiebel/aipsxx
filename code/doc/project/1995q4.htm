<U><B>AIPS++ Quarterly Report: 1995 Q4</B></U> 
<P>
Tim Cornwell, AIPS++ Project Manager
<P>
January 11, 1995
<H3>Introduction
</H3>

<P>
This report summarizes the status of the AIPS++ Project at the
end of the fourth quarter of 1995. It describes the achievements
during that quarter and gives a list of planned developments for
the first quarter of 1996. It also describes long-term plans for
the Project. Reports from each active AIPS++ site are included
in appendix A.
<H3>Developments
in 1995 Q4</H3>

<P>
In <B>Single Dish</B> processing, the Charlottesville-based group
(Bob Garwood, Darrel Schiebel, and Paul Shannon) continues to
work closely with the GBT on providing AIPS++ software for single
dish processing. The most important goal is to allow use of AIPS++
single dish data analysis processing by a first user on the NRAO
140' telescope in June 1996. This is a key milestone in the overall
goal of providing a complete SD analysis package for the commissioning
of the GBT, now expected in the summer of 1997.
<P>
In addition, the ATNF has decided to use AIPS++ to support an
HI survey using a 13-feed multi-beam system on the Parkes telescope,
scheduled for August 1996. The goals of the multi-beam project
and a development plan for the software are available on the WWW.
To support this work, David Barnes will travel to CV for 8 weeks
early next year to work with the SD group.
<P>
Darrell Schiebel has developed an extension to Glish, called Glishtk,
that allows construction of a Tk-widget based GUI from inside
Glish. This was originally developed for the GBT work, but is
expected to be used in a wide range of different applications.
It gives the ability to design and implement a GUI from the Glish
command line. Paul Shannon has developed a number of tools based
upon Glishtk, the major being a system for providing help for
users of Glish, and a tool for overseeing and controlling the
filling of GBT Monitor and Control data into AIPS++. Furthermore,
this work and the Tasking work by Brian Glendenning have led to
a design for the AIPS++ GUI. This design will be implemented over
the next few months using Glishtk and the Tasking classes.
<P>
A single dish development plan has been produced by Bob Garwood
taking into account the needs of GBT and the Parkes Multi-beam
projects. This plan is currently found on Bob's home page on the
WWW and soon will be checked into the AIPS++ system.
<P>
In <B>Measures</B>, Wim Brouw has made excellent progress on designing
and implementing the Measures Classes. Working from an original
design by Mark Calabretta, he expects to have all of the system,
apart from high-precision VLBI support, available by April 1996.
Much of the coding has been done now but he is now redesigning
the interface partly in response to comments by others and partly
as a result of his own experience in implementing the classes.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis</B> processing, Mark Wieringa and Tim Cornwell
have produced a design and implementation for synthesis calibration
and imaging based upon the Measurement Equation for a Generic
Interferometer developed by Hamaker, Bregman, Sault and others.
The short term goal is to produce a self-calibrated and cleaned
image from VLA data, incorporating corrections for polarization
leakage, by January 1996. Development will then proceed on various
fronts. One important goal will be to allow support of the commissioning
of the new WSRT on-line control system, TMS, expected to commence
in August 1996. Another is an early test of the AIPS++ GUI mentioned
above by implementing a general imaging and self-calibration task.
This will be made available to users for testing and use. A draft
development plan for the synthesis area is available from Tim
Cornwell's home page. This will be completed after receiving additional
advice on VLBI and BIMA processing.
<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, Tom Osterloo has joined
the AIPS++ Project at ATNF to work in collaboration with the NCSA
group headed by Dick Crutcher. This was agreed in late September.
Unfortunately, ATNF has since had to reallocate some of Tom's
time in the next year to support the Parkes Multibeam Project
with the result that the Image Analysis work that Tom was slated
to do will be delayed by about 6 months. This will delay Image
Analysis work at a time when some rudimentary capabilities will
be sorely needed. Negotiations are underway to find a solution.
<P>
The NCSA group has worked on the graphics capabilities in AIPS++.
Currently for the GBT tests, we use a Glish client, gplot1d, that
calls a commercial widget, Xrt/Graph. A tentative plan was to
replace this at some point with classes developed at Fermilab.
A better option is to instead use a Motif-based widget for the
Caltech PGPLOT library that is widely used in Astronomy. John
Pixton of NCSA is currently investigating this possibility. In
a related but separate line of development, Harold Ravlin is investigating
the possibility of including PGPLOT graphics directly in AIPSView.
<P>
In <B>Infrastructure</B>, the Table system continues to evolve
and grow towards completion. Ger van Diepen of NFRA has recently
worked on a Tiled Storage Manager that allows efficient access
to multi-dimensional arrays in different directions. This will
be vital in many different application areas. In addition, the
core group working on the related classes Table, Lattice and Image
(Ger van Diepen, Brian Glendenning and Tim Roberts) have worked
to act in response to applications needs. For example, the synthesis
work by Cornwell and Wieringa produced a requirement for the Image
class to allow images of objects of fixed form. The case in point
was an image of StokesVector: a class representing a vector in
I,Q,U,V space. A modification of the Table system was agreed to,
designed and implemented, all within a few weeks. Similar changes
to the AIPS++ library are expected to occur repeatedly in the
future as applications needs come to drive the Project.
<P>
Another area of infrastructure improvement is the porting of the
Newstar Linear Least Squares facilities (developed by Wim Brouw)
to AIPS++. This is still in progress.
<P>
In <B>Documentation,</B> we have resolved our staffing problem
mentioned in the last Quarterly report: Wes Young of the NRAO/Socorro
computing division is now allocated almost 100% to AIPS++ and
is working primarily on programmer documentation. A large number
of changes are now in progress. AIPS++ has adopted the Free Software
Foundation's gnats program to track bug reports and change requests.
The system has a particularly straightforward HTML interface that
we plan to link to from every piece of HTML documentation inside
AIPS++.
<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we have implemented automated testing
whereby the entire test suite is run weekly and the results monitored.
The goal is to catch problems with the Library early on. We are
now working towards rectifying existing problems. We have also
implemented registration of template specializations, and are
in the process of implementing shared libraries, something that
will be vital to reduce the typical size of executables.
<P>
The Project was well-represented at ADASS this year. <B>Presentations</B>
were made by Brian Glendenning (<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/papers/bgadass95.ps">Creating an Object-Oriented system: the AIPS++ experience</A>),
Dick Crutcher (<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/papers/rcadass95.ps">The AIPSView Astronomy Visualization Tool</A>),
and Bob Garwood (<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/papers/rgadass95.ps">AIPS++ and the GBT</A>),
and, in addition, posters were presented by Darrell Schiebel (<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/papers/dsadass95.ps">Programming in Glish</A>)
and Paul Shannon (<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/papers/psadass95.ps">GUI Tools in AIPS++</A>).
<P>
In <B>Management</B>, a major push was made during the last quarter
to formulate development plans for various key areas of the Project.
A development plan is essentially a detailed time-line with deliverables,
responsibilities and requirements on other parts of the Project
all laid out clearly. This is a vital discipline for a project
as diverse and complex as AIPS++, serving not only to aid in management
but also in ensuring that all members of the Project are aware
of goals and activities. We also implemented a formal scheme for
managing substantial changes to the system, involving a proposal,
request for comments, and decision date. A description is available
on the Web.
<H3>Long-term
plans</H3>

<P>
In the two previous quarterly reports, we have presented only
timelines for the next quarter. The AIPS++ development plan put
in place in the summer of 1995 purposefully had a look ahead time
of about a year. Now that the Project is running more smoothly
and achieving goals with some regularity, it is possible to lay
down longer-term plans. A list of AIPS++ goals is given in the
next table:

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
When reading this timetable, there are a number of points to be
borne in mind.
<UL>
<LI>The reliability gives an assessment of the probability of
meeting that goal. This is based upon a number of factors: how
well specified the goal is, the difficulty of the goal, and the
intrinsic priority of the goal to AIPS++.
<LI>We have purposefully targeted new or urgently needed capabilities
over reproducing functionality in existing packages such as AIPS,
Miriad or NewStar.
<LI>Reliabilities for time-critical observations (such as the
multibeam observing at Parkes) are higher than those for other,
non-time-critical items simply because our priority is to meeting
such commitments.
<LI>The key uncontrollable element in many of these items is the
success of a port to the relevant machine.
<LI>Staffing will have to increase as time goes on. AIPS++ is
staffed as a development project at the moment, so that we have
insufficient staff for system deployment to the large number of
sites expected eventually.
</UL>

<H3>Plans
for 1996 Q1</H3>

<P>
The previous section gave long-term plans. Here we summarize the
expected developments over the next quarter. The overview is that
applications development is heating up and key elements of the
AIPS++ library are approaching completion. Three time-critical
milestones occur later in the year (support at GBT, Parkes, and
WSRT), and so the work in this next quarter is largely in the
necessary preparation.
<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we will work towards the goal of
supporting the use of AIPS++ by a friendly observer on the 140'
telescope by June 1996. We will write a filler to load GBT data
to a single dish MeasurementSet. We will implement an improved
tablebrowser, based upon the Glishtk GUI machinery. We will write
a first GUI with simple astronomical task, and we will complete
approximately 50% of the Glish C++ clients needed for the observations.
David Barnes will visit Charlottesville to work with the group
for 8 weeks on support of the Parkes Multibeam observations.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we will finish a task to do polarization
leakage self-calibration and imaging, we will improve gridding
and the use of FFTs, we will ensure persistence for calibration
objects, we will develop capabilities for simulation of synthesis
observations, and will write a first GUI-based imaging task. In
preparation for the commissioning of the WSRT TMS, we will write
a filler to load WSRT data into a Synthesis MeasurementSet. We
will start a collaboration between the Synthesis group and NCSA
to investigate and possibly implement selected synthesis algorithms
on parallel processing machines.
<P>
In <B>Measures</B>, we will complete a re-design of the classes.
A completed Measures implementation will be available by the end
of the quarter with only one exception, support for high precision
VLBI, which is expected later in the year.
<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we will continue work on the
Table system, finishing the Tiled storage manager and improving
the existing Run-Length-Encoded storage manager (called the &quot;Miriad&quot;
storage manager). We will complete a re-write of the File and
I/O classes. We will implement a system allowing time-changing
data such as IERS data to be available inside AIPS++ via the Tables
system. The VLA calibrator list will be one of the first sources
of data included. The implementation of the tasking system will
continue, first with the control hub and C++ run-time system,
and then with a sample application to the Table system.
<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, we will re-implement
the gplot1d Glish client on top of the PGPLOT graphics widget.
We will also investigate putting PGPLOT graphics capabilities
directly into AIPSView. We will add hardcopy output to AIPSView.
<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we will fully implement shared libraries,
add automatic registration for the AIPS++ e-mail exploders (a
&quot;majordomo&quot;), and transfer the AIPS++ master code repository
to Socorro. We will attempt ports to the g++ compiler, and to
Dec Alphas, SGI and HP/UX configurations. We will implement the
now-standard compiler exception mechanism.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we will revise the programmer's section
of the on-line documentation, identify and remove out-of-date
documents. We will revise the format of source code documentation.
We will put programming entries in the AIPS++ Glossary. We will
fully implement and start to use the gnats bug reporting system.
<P>
In<B> Management</B>, we will form and schedule a meeting of a
Scientific Advisory Group for AIPS++. Tim Cornwell will visit
Pune for discussions with GMRT staff.
<P>
In addition, Alan Ferris of STScI is re-designing and re-implementing
the FITS classes used by AIPS++. We will benefit directly from
this work.
<H3>Requests
for action or approval</H3>

<OL>
<LI><U>Increased staffing:</U> For the last year, the staffing
of the Project was well-matched to the activities planned. Now
that we are moving towards considerable applications development,
the Project is becoming short on staff in various areas. We should
anticipate <I>adding </I>or <I>reallocating</I> staff sometime
this year to a number of areas:
<UL>
<LI>an AIPS++ scientific programmer at GB,
<LI>a scientific programmer at NFRA to help with the AIPS++ support
of the TMS commissioning,
<LI>scientific programmers at the AOC and at ATNF to help with
development of Synthesis processing.
</UL>

</OL>

<P>
<I>Executive committee response: NFRA is actively searching. Others
took note.</I> 
<OL>
<LI><U>AIPS++ Scientific and Technical Advisory Group: </U>The
role of this group is to provide advice on scientific and technical
matters to the AIPS++ Project Manager. We would like to aim for
a small group of people initially, probably no more than 8. We
expect that the group will grow in size as AIPS++ expands. This
group would meet for a few days and then write a report to be
given to the Project Manager and then passed on to the Executive
Committee. It would meet first in Fall 1996 and thereafter yearly
or more frequently, as desired by the Project Manager. To fill
the membership, we would like 3 or 4 nominations from each Director
on the Executive Committee. We prefer astronomers with a good
background in computing issues. We propose that each organization
pay the travel costs of its nominees and that NRAO will pay for
the costs of the meeting.
</OL>

<I>Executive
committee response: approved, nominations will be submitted shortly.
</I>

<H3>Appendix
A: Site reports</H3>

<H4>ATNF
</H4>

<P>
The ATNF currently has 4 active workers, as well as Neil Killeen,
the local manager. These are Mark Calabretta, Wim Brouw, Mark
Wieringa and Tom Oosterloo. Tom has just joined the project in
early December. Bob Sault acts in a consultant mode.
<P>
The 21cm Parkes multibeam project (joint ATNF and several Universities
about the world) has chosen to use AIPS++ as its software platform.
Multibeam project members who are writing software will thus collaborate
closely with AIPS++ project staff. In particular, David Barnes
from the University of Melbourne will visit Charlottesville in
early 1996 for 2 months.
<P>
Mark Calabretta's main responsibility is to the code distribution
system. His time in the last quarter has been spent on:
<UL>
<LI>Designing and implementing a system for registering template
specializations for the Sun native compiler.
<LI>Implementing a system for registering source-specific compiler
options.
<LI>Developing an automated test procedure, including rationalization
of the scripts which invoke the tests.
<LI>Sharable libraries - implemented but many problems remain
to be overcome.
<LI>Numerous lesser enhancements to the code distribution and
compilation system.
<LI>Released WCSLIB 2.2. Also wrote appendix A of the WCS draft
concerning the &quot;Pixel Regularization Image&quot; to be used
to apply optical plate solutions.
</UL>

<P>
Mark has spent approximately 60% of his time on AIPS++ related
work (including WCSLIB). His nominal AIPS++ allocation is 50%
At present, this level will be sustained indefinitely.
<P>
Wim Brouw's responsiblity is mainly to designing and implementing
the Measure and related Classes. His time has been spent on
<UL>
<LI>Prototyping different Measure classes
<LI>Finalising the design and discussion, leading to a draft development
plan
<LI>Participating in discussions with the ITA, St. Petersburg.
He has coded routines for:
<UL>
<LI>precession (IAU)
<LI>nutation (IAU/Wahr)
<LI>aberration (Czech analytical expansion DE200)
<LI>ray bending: still being discussed with ITA
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
All routines have entries for further corrections (IERS etc).
<UL>
<LI>Code copping and discussion about least squares solution
<LI>Making Quantities and Measures SUN-native compiler compatible
</UL>

<P>
Wim has spent 17% (October), 40% (November) and 12% (December)
on AIPS++.
<P>
Mark Wieringa is a part of the team working on the interferometry
related classes. He has just returned from 3 months in Socorro
working with Tim Cornwell. He has spent his AIPS++ time on the
basic design and implementation of full polarization calibration
and imaging for &quot;generic&quot; interferometers. Good progress
on the basic framework is now in place. Mark spent substantial
time on efficiency aspects, and writing fast square matrix and
stokes vector classes used in the computations.
<P>
Mark has spent 100% of his time on AIPS++ in this quarter. His
nominal AIPS++ allocation is 50%. Mark will return to Socorro
for a further 3 months in February. Mark's involvement in AIPS++
is negotiated yearly with Narrabri since he has been seconded
to the project from the Narrabri Computer Group. Currently the
agreement is until mid-1996.
<P>
Tom Oosterloo joined the AIPS++ project at the ATNF in December
1995; his appointment comers through the IISE demonstrator funding
mentioned in the last quarterly report. He is working on visualization
and image analysis software. This work involves collaboration
with the NCSA AIPS++ group. The demonstrator positions have a
joint divisional component. In this case, Tom will spend some
time collaborating with the DRP ALLSITE project (a virtual work
bench for sophisticated exploration of data sets). Tom is currently
working on
<UL>
<LI>Reviewing AipsView as a stand-alone task and as a canvas for
other AIPS++ programs.
<LI>Specification of volume rendering with regards hot gas shaders
</UL>

<P>
Tom's nominal AIPS++ allocation is 75%. However, he is also currently
winding up some work from his previous ATNF appointment, so he
will be not be available for his full AIPS++ allocation until
about mid February.
<P>
Neil Killeen currently does no actual code work and spends his
AIPS++ time attending to local ATNF AIPS++ management issues.
In the last quarter this largely revolved around
<P>
filling the IISE demonstrator position (Tom Oosterloo). This included
planning and negotiating with Tim Cornwell and Dick Crutcher on
the area of work and its structure for the next year or so. It
also involved negotiating with the CSIRO Division of Radiophysics
on the joint divisional aspects. Neil was also involved in discussing
AIPS++ with Parkes 21cm multibeam project members and helping
to facilitate the collaboration between them and the AIPS++ project
<P>
Neil has no nominal AIPS++ time allocation, and the load varies.
A guess at the load is that averaged over the last quarter, he
has spent some 15% of his time on AIPS++.
<H4>BIMA
</H4>

<H5>Personnel
activity:</H5>

<P>
AIPS++ activity has been in the area of visualization and graphics.
Polly Baker, John Pixton, and George Baxter worked mainly on the
OpenInventor 3D AIPSview code. The ability of the user to control
the transfer functions used in mapping data to graphics has been
extended. We also experimented with saving the current state of
a visualization in a file format (SVML) that can be read by a
CAVE viewer program that we developed. Eventually, this will provide
a unified environment for data exploration across both desktop
and virtual reality platforms. Other new functionality in OpenInventor
AIPSview includes the ability to save a current visualization
as a VRML file for sharing on the WWW. VRML files have been generated
and are accessible for a number of data sets in the NCSA Astronomy
Digital Image Library. This collection of VRML files has also
been made accessible from the NCSA VRML home page. We expect to
release OpenInventor AIPSview to the astronomy community sometime
next year.
<P>
John Pixton also spent time on Glish development within AIPSview
and investigation of vector graphics options. He is now working
essentially 100% time on AIPS++ vector graphics. Harold Ravlin
responded to user queries (help in installation and minor bug
fixes) generated by our release of the 2D AIPSview code to the
community at the end of September. Currently, over 100 people
have registered themselves (through our AIPSview Web page) as
AIPSview users. Harold also began work on adding vector graphics
capability to AIPSview; this included learning about the PGPLOT
library and using it to draw onto the AIPSview canvas for coordinate
annotation, contours, and xy plotting. These features are expected
to be in the released code by Feb. 15, followed by postscript
output capability.

<H5>Conferences
and presentations:</H5>

<P>
Dick Crutcher gave an invited talk on AIPSview at the ADASS V
conference in Tucson and presented an on-going demonstration of
AIPSview during the conference. His ADASS paper on AIPSview is
checked into the AIPS++ system.
<P>
Dick Crutcher, Polly Baker, John Pixton, and Doug Roberts attended
the Supercomputing 95 conference in San Diego and gave a demonstration
of radio synthesis imaging data processing on remote parallel
CPUs and of AIPSview visualization. Baker was also a member of
the Technical Program Committee and chaired a paper session.
<P>
Polly Baker and George Baxter attended the annual IEEE Visualization
'95 conference in Atlanta, GA. Baker was a member of the Conference
Committee and organized the Birds-of-a-Feather sessions. Baxter
(along with Pixton) was a co-author of the paper &quot;Crumbs:
A virtual environment tracking tool for biological imaging&quot;,
which was presented by NCSA staff member Rachel Brady at the conference's
symposium on Biomedical Imaging.

Local project members: Ger van Diepen (GVD), Jan Noordam (JEN,
local manager), Friso Olnon (FMO), Jayaram Chengalur (JNC, local
Project Scientist)
<H5>General
</H5>

<P>
NFRA is pleased with the level of consultation. The items from
the &quot;NFRA Requirements for AIPS++&quot; find their way into
the designs and plans. Noordam and Chengalur are actively following
the design and implementation of the first version of uv-data
calibration and imaging based on the M.E. Special concerns about
tied arrays, the interface to the SkyModel, and the generality
of the M.E. matrix expression have been met. Redundant Spacing
Calibration will be addressed in a later stage.
<H5>TMS
</H5>

<P>
Together with Marco de Vos, the project leader of the new WSRT
on-line system TMS, a list of requirements was compiled for AIPS++
to support the first version of TMS in august 1996. TMS designs
and plans can be accessed via the web.
<H5>AIPS++
applications </H5>

<P>
Olnon is on schedule to deliver a working prototype of the WSRT
uv-data `filler' by the end of December.
<H5>AIPS++
Site in Dwingeloo</H5>

<P>
The local AIPS++ installation in Dwingeloo causes very few problems.
Olnon checks the weekly `inhales' and makes small changes in the
configuration where necessary.
<H5>Infrastructure
</H5>

<P>
Van Diepen continues to work on the Table System, under the guidance
of Brian Glendenning at the Centre. The tiled hypercube storage
manager has been finished. It is now possible to dynamically add
new columns to an existing or new data manager. A new data manager
has been created which can store arrays of data objects directly
into a table. Finally, Van Diepen has polished various aspect
of the table system, including documentation and test programs.
<P>
Van Diepen's student Anco Boersma has finished the classes Path
and File. Van Diepen has contributed to the debate about improvement
of cxx2html.
<H5>Miscellaneous
</H5>

<P>
NFRA shares with ATNF the cost of sending Mark Wieringa to the
Centre, and contributes to the salary of one of the new Centre
programmers.
<P>
It turns out to be difficult to find suitable candidates for a
joint NFRA/JIVE position for an AIPS++ application programmer
in Dwingeloo. We have dropped the requirement of experience in
aperture synthesis, and concentrate on proven productivity and
some experience in OOP/C++.
<P>
All three papers on Radio Polarimetry by Hamaker, Bregmam and
Sault have been accepted by A+A without modifications. Hamaker
will give a talk on the subject at the URSI General Assembly in
1996. Noordam has updated Note 185, the `official' description
of the M.E. in AIPS++.
<P>
The Software Engineering Group (SEG) at NFRA, of which Olnon and
Van Diepen are members, has produced an &quot;C++ Coding Standard
for NFRA&quot; and a &quot;Configuration Standard for NFRA&quot;.
An internal workshop was held about the last subject. All SEG
documents are available on the web: (URL: <A HREF="http://www.nfra.nl/~olnon/seg">http://www.nfra.nl/~olnon/seg</A>).

<H5>Personnel
</H5>

<P>
We are pleased to have Shelby Yang join the Socorro AIPS++ group.
He arrived in November. Ralph Marson is due to arrive in early
January. Wes Young is now working 90% of his time inside AIPS++,
principally on Programmer Documentation.
<H5>Support
</H5>

<P>
All members of the Charlottesville group continue to make extensive
visits to Green Bank to support the GBT work. A two-day meeting
with the GBT Monitor and Control group was held in Green Bank
in early December to discuss a number of issues relating to the
ongoing AIPS++/GBT activities.
<H5>Network
problems</H5>

<P>
A major problem with the code management and distribution system
occured when a hacker break-in at Charlottesville caused that
site to severely curtail temporarily its Internet accessibility.
Since this is the site of the AIPS++ code repository, this broke
the code management and distribution system temporarily and caused
many sorts of unexpected obstacles for a few weeks following,
impairing the productivity of many people in the Project. The
Charlottesville computer staff acted quickly and efficiently to
first stop the break-in and then restore essential services such
as the AIPS++ code distribution system. Although a firewall is
now in place in Charlottesville, we may still be open to such
attacks in the future.
<H5>Meetings
</H5>

<P>
The group in Socorro has bi-monthly meetings on AIPS++-related
subjects.
<H3>Appendix
B: Summary of AIPS++ Personnel</H3>

<P>
In this section, I give the names of people in the various AIPS++
groups and the nominal fraction of tiem allocated to AIPS++.
<P>
The <B>ATNF</B> group is: Mark Calabretta (50%), Wim Brouw (50%),
Mark Wieringa (50%) and Tom Oosterloo (75%), with Neil Killeen
as the local Manager.
<P>
The <B>BIMA/NCSA</B> group currently has 4 active workers, as
well as Dick Crutcher, the local manager. These are Polly Baker
(50%), John Pixton (100%), Harold Ravlin (80%), and George Baxter
(50%); Doug Roberts is expected to become an active AIPS++ worker
at the 50% level in 1996 (as soon as SGI Array porting and development
work becomes appropriate). In addition, Jim Morgan and Peter Teuben
at Maryland follow AIPS++ developments and expect to become directly
involved in the future.
<P>
The <B>NFRA</B> group is: Ger van Diepen (100%), Jan Noordam (25%),
Friso Olnon (50%), and Jayaram Chengalur (25%)
<P>
The <B>NRAO</B> group is: Tim Cornwell (100%), Bob Garwood (90%),
Brian Glendenning (100%), Tim Roberts (100%), Darrell Schiebel
(100%), Paul Shannon (100%), Shelby Yang(100%), and Wes Young
(90%). Ralph Marson will join the group in January 1996 at 100%
AIPS++ activities. In addition, a number of scientists participate
at various levels: Alan Bridle, Rick Fisher, Bob Hjellming, Harvey
Liszt.
<H3>Appendix C: Review of developments
promised for 1995 Q3</H3>

<P>
This section has been written to mirror the section in the last
quarterly report on plans for 1995 Q3.
<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we did continue support of the
GBT tests. A development plan for Single Dish targeted for mid
November was delivered in early December.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we did continue development of the
measurement equation for a general interferometer. We were able
to make images, deconvolve and self-calibrate polarization measurements,
but not for production. The initial goals for continuing development
will be a Clean algorithm for simultaneous deconvolution of Stokes
I,Q,U and V, and self-calibration of the antenna-based polarization
leakage terms.
<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we continued but did not finish
work on the tiled storage manager for the Table system (needed
for efficient access of multidimensional data). We did finish
design and start on implementation of classes for Task control
and interaction. We did continue with the development of Coordinate
classes now proceeding under the supervision of Wim Brouw. We
started but did not finish work on improved linear algebra classes
(needed for the Coordinate classes, and other areas).
<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, the collaboration
between ATNF and NCSA has been slow to start. The ATNF visualization
work will now be substantially delayed due to a re-allocation
of staff.
<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we are in the process of implementing
shared libraries (thus reducing executable size). We did start
to use by default the new Sun native code compiler (speeding compilations
substantially), and implement a bug reporting system. We did not
implement release versions. The move of the AIPS++ master code
repository to Socorro has been deferred until January 1996.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we did resolve our staffing problem and
start progress.
<P>
In<B> Management</B>, we did not closely evaluate the NFRA Software
Engineering Group activities.
