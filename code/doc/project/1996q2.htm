</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the second quarter of 1996, we proceeded with
work aimed towards a beta release of AIPS++ targeted for early
1997. We also worked towards supporting the use of AIPS++ for
a number of applications: an HI survey using a multibeam system
on the Parkes telescope, as the prime data reduction system for
the GBT, and used as the prime on-line data inspection system
for the new WSRT on-line system, TMS. We have continued development
of the infrastructure needed to support these activities, in the
Table system, in the User interface, in the Measures system, and
in documentation. Work in all of these areas has proceeded reasonably
well, although continuing problems with compilers have generally
slowed the Project. The most significant obstacle has been continuing
difficulties in some areas of design, most particularly the design
of the single dish analysis package, this resulting in a delay
of a few months in the first tests of a single dish package for
the GBT. A cross comparison of synthesis processing by Newstar
and AIPS++ has been performed and confirms that the AIPS++ synthesis
package can reproduce the results from Newstar even at very high
levels of precision. First tests of programming AIPS++ by non-expert
programmers have also been encouraging, showing that the promises
of object-oriented programming are to some extent being realized.
Planning for the beta and full releases is continuing, and a detailed
list of the targeted contents of the first beta release has been
drawn up.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc362226432">Introduction</A><BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This report summarizes the status of the AIPS++ Project
at the end of the second quarter of 1996. It describes the achievements
during that quarter and gives a list of planned developments for
the third quarter of 1996. It also describes long-term plans for
the Project. Reports from each active AIPS++ site are included
in appendix A.</FONT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc362226433">Developments in 199</A>6 Q2<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Single Dish</B>, after some unsuccessful attempts,
we produced, with the help of Harvey Liszt, a design for SDCalc,
an application for essentially interactive processing of one-dimensional
data sets. SDCalc is principally intended for single dish spectral
analysis but we anticipate that it will also be used for many
different applications that require interactive perusal and processing
of data from a telescope.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Measures</B>, we completed the implementation
of the Measures system, omitting for the moment the highest precision
support needed for VLBI and pulsar observations. This latter will
be added once the specifications are more fully known, probably
later this year. We have developed a system for automatically
acquiring and loading IERS data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Synthesis</B> , we converted the synthesis
code to use the AIPS++ Distributed Object system whereby objects
in the system are accessible from Glish. This has three immediate
advantages, first a simple and flexible user interface is available
using Glish and a Distributed Object GUI (the DOG) written in
Glish, second, each of the methods of the DO are available from
Glish thus allowing great flexibility, and third, the methods
of the various objects can be invoked from Glish functions or
scripts thus allowing programming of significant applications
solely from the Glish level.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To test and demonstrate the synthesis code, we processed
a 21cm WSRT observation of 3C147, correcting for a number of effects:
antenna-based gains, polarization leakage, and correlator-based
gains. This was performed using a script written in Glish that
constructed the necessary distributed objects and then invoked
the various methods as required. This processing was originally
performed at the Center, but is now possible at Dwingeloo on the
HP/UX systems using the Gnu compiler. In addition, we processed
data from a variety of different VLA observations to test the
capability to solve for polarization leakage. We also processed
some 20cm observations of Jupiter (kindly provided by Imke de
Pater) to test the efficacy of the joint deconvolution of Stokes
I,Q,U, and V. Satisfyingly but perhaps not too surprisingly it
appears that the results from joint deconvolution are superior
to those obtained from separate deconvolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We developed a design for cross-calibration of synthesis
data using the synthesis code. This draws upon the various strengths
of the AIPS++ Table system to provide simple data selection capabilities.
This design is now being implemented.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a test of the capability of non-experienced programmers
to add significant new features to the synthesis code, Jan Noordam
wrote a &quot;MeasurementComponent&quot; to include ionosphere
corrections into AIPS++, as will be needed for the new UHF receivers
in Westerbork.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, the aipsview
program has proceeded to beta release after the incorporation
of contour plotting capabilities, postscript generation, and control
via Glish. The Glish plotting client, gplot1d, has been rewritten
to be based upon the well-known PGPLOT library developed by Tim
Pearson at Caltech, using a Motif widget written by Martin Shepherd.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of the advanced visualization program
OpenInventor aipsview has been discontinued due to Polly Baker
leaving the NCSA group. In this context, it is now clear that
we need a C++-based tool-kit for image visualization. We investigated
the possibility of adapting the aipsview library to this purpose
and concluded that it is not feasible. Hence our final major changes
to aipsview will be the addition of AIPS++ Image and Coordinate
class support to allow reading of AIPS++ native images, and fully
accurate coordinate display.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Image analysis development has proceeded at a low
level, mainly via the work of Neil Killeen, as detailed in the
ATNF site report given below. One interesting aspect of that work
has been Neil's assessment of the difficulty of programming in
C++ using the AIPS++ library of classes:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;I have found that writing top-level C++
application quite straightforward (once you know your way about
AIPS++). Since at the top level one must write something procedural,
this does not require any great depth of knowledge of C++ or OO
design.&quot;<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>AIPS++</B> <B>Infrastructure</B>, the Glish
program has been through a process of improving robustness and
stability that seems to have significantly improved it. The documentation
has been revised to incorporate a number of changes made recently,
the most notable being the incorporation of the Tk-widget set,
thus allowing GUIs to be constructed from inside Glish. We expect
that a release of Glish 2.6 will be made in the next quarter.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Table system has seen a number of substantial
improvements and additions. It is now possible to retrieve an
entire table row at once (both from C++ and from Glish). Tables
now have type information easily accessible. A number of implementation
changes have been made in response to timing and performance information
from the various uses of the Table system that are now occurring.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We finished the design and implementation of the
PagedImage class. We developed a class for Linear fitting. We
completed version 1 of the Distributed Object system and implemented
a GUI component (the DOG) written in Glish to allow interactive
selection of DO methods and associated parameters. A filechooser
and datachooser have also been written and incorporated in the
DOG.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Documentation,</B> we developed programmer
documentation, checking in a Programmer's Reference Manual. We
started implementation of a powerful system, designed by Paul
Shannon, for providing various levels of user help from the Glish
prompt.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the <B>System</B> area, we continued development
of the support needed for the Gnu C++ compiler. Since the Gnu
compiler does not perform automatic instantiation of the templates
required for a program, this burden falls upon the programmers.
We wrote tools to aid this work. Although the extra work involved
in thus instantiating templates is not negligible, the general
reaction to the Gnu compiler has been positive since the operation
of the compiler is very straightforward. From a project perspective,
one key attraction of the Gnu compiler is that it does allow straightforward
porting of AIPS++ to new platforms. All consortium sites except
NCSA are now running Gnu systems. We plan to make it the default
compiler so that all AIPS++ code must run under Gnu.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We moved the master repository of AIPS++ code to
Socorro. This move was quite painless and has had few unforeseen
consequences.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We implemented some tools for determining the user
of templates in executables, and then evaluated the impact of
the widespread use of templates on executable size. We have developed
strategies for reducing executable size but these have had to
be deferred temporarily for the lack of a person to implement
them.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, we made many other improvements to the
code management system. For example, the e-mail archives are now
search-able by content.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Management, </B>we made presentations to the
NRAO Visiting Committee and the Users Committee and to the BIMA
board. The first two were accompanied by demonstrations by Rick
Fisher and by Tim Cornwell respectively.</FONT>

<P>
As before, the reliability gives an assessment of the probability
of meeting that goal. This is based upon a number of factors:
how well specified the goal is, the difficulty of the goal, and
the intrinsic <A NAME="_Toc345643206">priority of the goal to
AIPS++.</A><BR>

<P>
A number of milestones have been passed since the last report
(denoted by the mark). Some have been shifted in time.
<H3><A NAME="_Toc362226435">Plans for 1996 Q</A>3<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The previous section gave long-term plans. Here we
summarize the expected developments over the next quarter. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we will produce a
prototype of the SDCalc single dish analysis application. We will
support the use of AIPS++ for the analysis needs of the Parkes
multi-beam survey. We will finish a reader and a writer for single
dish fits (SDFITS), conduct interoperability tests with other
observatories, and write a paper describing the format.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we will implement the
cross-calibration design, add a GUI and write documentation. We
will add fitting of components to both images and visibility data.
We will support investigations of time-variability of VLA D-terms
using the code. AIPS++ synthesis code will be used as for first
pass analysis of data from WSRT as needed for the commissioning
of TMS. Sanjay Bhatnager of GMRT will come to Socorro for 3-4
months to work with the Synthesis group on polarization calibration
and imaging. Cornwell and Wieringa will present a paper on ADASS
on the design and implementation of the synthesis code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Measures</B>, we will add support for use of
IERS bulletins. We will complete the review of the submitted code.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Glish support</B>, we will develop a test suite
and make release 2.6. We will start work on object orientation
inside Glish.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, a Table storage
manager, the IncrementalStMan, for handling columns in which the
information changes infrequently will be completed. We will allow
Records (containers of heterogeneous information) to be stored
in Tables. We will write and document version 2 of the Distributed
Object system. We will develop a class for non-linear fitting,
and add constraints to the existing linear fitting classes. We
will implement a modified strategy for coding exceptions in C++
code. We will design and implement new Gridding and FFT classes
to replace the ones currently used since they have a number of
serious deficiencies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, we will
finish incorporation of AIPS++ Image and Coordinates classes into
aipsview, and make a beta release of the new aipsview. We will
start work on a C++-based tool-kit for visualization. We will
finish an image statistics program.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the <B>System</B> area, we will improve end-user
installation procedures, particularly for installation from binaries
alone.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Documentation</B>, we will finish the user
help system and start to write end-user documentation using it.
We will finish the initial version of the Programmer's Reference
Manual.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Management</B>, we will organize the first
meeting of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Group.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><A NAME="_Toc362226436">Plans for Beta and First releases</A>
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have to ensure that the beta release will be attractive
for both astronomers, primarily, and programmers, secondarily.
Given the desire to release in about 6 months and to test adequately,
we have to ensure that the targeted software is either present
now in some form or is feasible to develop in a few months. Bearing
this in mind, the following areas make sense as explicit targets:

<H5><A NAME="_Toc362226439"><I>General<BR>
</I></A></H5>

<P>
The ATNF currently has 5 people working in AIPS++. These are Neil
Killeen (local manager), Mark Calabretta, Wim Brouw, Mark Wieringa
and Tom Oosterloo. Additionally, there is a collaboration between
the AIPS++ project and the ATNF headed Parkes 21cm multibeam receiver
project (see report below for details of people) which is contributing
substantial effort to 
<P>
using and developing code within AIPS++.
<H5><A NAME="_Toc362226440"><I>System<BR>
</I></A></H5>

<P>
We continue to struggle with the weekly inhale which is built
on our Ultra server 140. We build the native, gnu and cfront systems.
There are problems with the Ultra that regularly cause the rebuild
to fail. SUN are investigating with reasonably high priority at
this point. It is still often Tuesday or Wednesday before we have
the system operational. We will implement a dual, leap-frogging
system in the near future so that we will always have one functioning
system.<BR>

<P>
Regardless, it continues to emphasise that AIPS++ extends the
host computing environment significantly, even for the most uptodate
computers, and this is of concern not only for the developers,
but also for the non-consortium customers, who will seize upon
such issues as reasons not to bother with AIPS++. We have learnt
an important lesson at the ATNF through other software: it is
hard to recover users once they have an initial, bad experience,
even if you address all of their problems. First reactions linger.

<P>
The port to the DEC Alpha (Unix) using the Gnu compiler is very
close to succeeding. This is essential for the multibeam project
which will use AIPS++ on an Alpha at Parkes for its data pipeline.
The remaining problems revolve about idiosyncrasies of the Alpha
that have to be worked around. At present, AIPS++ is compiled
but not installed.

Tom Oosterloo is working on visualization and image analysis software.
Additionally he has been seconded to the multibeam group to help
them with their AIPS++ software effort. His time in the last quarter
has been spent on 
<UL>
<LI>Examining the AipsView classes in order to understand whether
they can be used as a basis for an image display library or not.
To quote, &quot;I stared myself blind on the code&quot;. Tom's
conclusion is that the AipsView classes lack the flexibility required
of an image display library. He proposes that we combine the lessons
learned from AipsView and Karma (ATNF graphics display library
[plus other things] written by Richard Gooch) and create the ultimate.
<LI>Multibeam data monitor: made a number of prototypes to get
a feel for what it should look like. Settled for 3D approach (ie
data is 3D with axes time, beam and channel) and use a more or
less conventional tool (like aipsview or kubes) to display the
data. This seems to give the most useful and interactive display
of the data, especially when combined with some simple line graphics.

<LI>Deciding what is needed for the monitor took quite some time,
partly because of little feedback from other multibeam group members
on requirements for the data monitor. The major consideration
here was whether to use a modified version of AipsView or to make
everything ourselves using Karma. The principle of least action
suggests that it is probably best to make modifications to AipsView,
since these modifications may be relatively minor (although it
still has to be established if this is really the case). We just
started discussions with the AipsView group on how to proceed.

Neil Killeen spends his AIPS++ time attending to local ATNF AIPS++

<LI>Looking after (trying to) Epping system whilst Mark Calabretta
was in Socorro
<LI>Liasing with multibeam group
<LI>Discussions with Tom Oosterloo about image display library
<LI>Discussion with Brian, Wim and ATNF ATOMS group
<LI>Code copping the lattice classes. 
<LI>Coding: Neil says: &quot;For my coding, I started out trying
to write an image calculator in Glish. I then rapidly backed out
of Glish as its speed was not sufficient for this kind of operation,
even with its built in functions. Better will be to control distributed
objects from Glish. Instead, I started to write a simple C++ image
statistics program. This then combined learning C++ with learning
AIPS++. I have produced a first generation program controlled
from the command line for iterating through an image, gathering
statistics over specified axes and displaying them. I am now working
on taking the internals that are not specific to this program
and am developing them into a class available for general image
analysis applications. Eventually then these objects will be converted
to distributed objects that can also be controlled from Glish.
I have found that writing top-level C++ application quite straightforward
(once you know your way about AIPS++). Since at the top level
one must write something procedural, this does not require any
great depth of knowledge of C++ or OO design. This is one of the
goals of AIPS++, that it will be easy to write top level applications
by providing an appropriate array of classes that can be put together
straightforwardly by the programmer. My experience so far encourages
me that this is true.&quot;

Neil has no nominal AIPS++ time allocation, and the load varies.
Averaged over the last quarter, he has spent some 40% of his time

Problems discovered with glish transfer rates, glish events being
lost and glish hanging. Darrell contacted about items which seem
to be bugs. No resolution yet.
<LI>Multibeam glish record defined. Template record unwrapper
and client defined by Barnes. Optimization and stripping improved
speed and size enormously.
<LI>kview (Karma) given glish functionality by Gooch, for test
purposes.
<LI>aipsview trialled by Oosterloo for data quality monitoring
purposes (time-frequency-beam number cubes). Very inefficient
compared with kview due to lack of buffering/scrolling, but aipsview
modifications will be requested.
<LI>aipsview trialled for OTF mapping purposes. Again a few changes
would improve performance. Oosterloo to pass requests to Crutcher
and Cornwell.
<LI>gplot1d trialled for on-line monitoring. OK, but not efficient
for large numbers of spectra. aipsview also gives 1-d profile
capability.
<LI>Correlator format fully specified (rpfits extension). Software
tested on-line.

Polly Baker has left the BIMA/NCSA AIPS++ group in order to pursue
other visualization activities at NCSA. Graduate student George
Baxter was unwilling to switch to AIPS++ visualization work from
the Inventor Aipsview project he and Baker were working on. The
loss of these personnel made it necessary to terminate the Inventor
Aipsview software project. Active AIPS++ workers are now Dick
Crutcher (the local manager), John Pixton (100%), Harold Ravlin
(80%), and Doug Roberts (50%). In addition, Peter Teuben at Maryland
follows AIPS++ developments and will start work on a BIMA AIPS++
filler later this summer. Yanti Maio will join the NCSA AIPS++
visualization team at the 50% level in July while she pursues
an advanced degree in CS, after finishing a PhD in radio astronomy.

A beta 1.1 version of Aipsview was released. This version fixed
a number of bugs and added a number of new features: glish control,
postscript printing capability, and pgplot graphics capability
for contouring and line profile plotting and coordinate axis annotation.
In addition, the pgplot-based gplot1d widget was finished and
checked in. Ravlin and Pixton visited Socorro for a week to work
with the AIPS++ center; they are now working on a significant

A 21cm WSRT observation of 3c147 has been successfully reduced
and displayed by AIPS++, both in Socorro an Dwingeloo. This required
flagging of bad data, and solutions for Image Sky Model, gain
(GJones), leakage (DJones) and multiplicative interferometer errors
(MJones). The end result has the same quality as the NEWSTAR result
with the same dataset, i.e. very close to the theoretical noise.
It reproduces the very low-level extended emission in Stokes Q.
The exercise constituted a useful check of AIPS++ genericity for
different telescopes, and for the various sign conventions between
WSRT archive format and AIPS++. It gives confidence that the `alpha'
release of AIPS++ will have sufficient functionality to support
the first version of the new WSRT on-line system (TMS) in august.
The main worry in this respect remains the C++ compiler situation.
<BR>

<P>
Jayaram Chengalur will move to the GMRT in early July. Although
other work has prevented him from getting deeply involved, he
will continue taking an interest in AIPS++ in Pune. He will maintain
close links with the AIPS++ group in Dwingeloo.<BR>

Friso Olnon has corrected and adapted the prototype WSRT filler
in response to the needs of the above-mentioned 3c147 reduction.
The filler will be made more general, and upgraded with new record
and IO-classes, in time for TMS commissioning.<BR>

<P>
Jan Noordam has written an FJones solver, by adapting just one
of the methods of the GJones solver. This demonstrates the reuse
capability of Object-Oriented programming. It is part of his efforts
to include ionosphere corrections into AIPS++ in time for the
new UHF receivers in Westerbork by the end of 1996.

<P>
The CenterLine C++ compiler used in Dwingeloo will soon disappear.
In anticipation of the elevation of the GNU compiler as `default'
compiler for AIPS++, Friso Olnon and Ger van Diepen are adapting
the local AIPS++ installation (and the AIPS++ code) for its standard
use, also on the many HP hosts used at NFRA. In the meantime,
we have to keep alive three parallel AIPS++ systems, so that development
work by Ger van Diepen and Jan Noordam can continue. We only just
succeed in doing that, more or less. Especially the HP/GNU branch
is still quite rudimentary, and takes (too) much time to get working.
<BR>

<P>
At the same time more and more AIPS++ applications (Glish clients
mostly) become available, with which we can inspect and reduce
our data ourselves, and even compose our own procedures. These
applications also require extra attention in terms of supporting
programs and configuration.

Ger van Diepen has improved the table system in several ways:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The new (Table)Record classes have been finalized and checked
into the system, while the KeywordSet classes have been removed.
This change required that software using KeywordSet had to be
changed, but that worked out very well.
<LI>All table classes and test programs compile and link with
the g++ compiler.
<LI>The TableExprNode classes have been de-templated. Many functions
were specialized, so it made little sense to use templates. Furthermore
functions (like cos, max) have been added to those classes and
to the table command grammar. The documentation in Tables.h has
been extended with a description of the table command grammar.
<LI>The class TableRow has been developed and checked into the
system. It makes it possible to access (part of) a row as a whole.
It can use the new TableRecord class very nicely.
<LI>The class TableInfo has been developed. It makes it possible
to define the type of a table (e.g. MeasurementSet, Image) and
use that information in the DataChooser.
<LI>The glish client gtable has been extended with functions and
events to handle a TableRow and TableInfo object.
<LI>The AipsIO storage manager has been changed to avoid excessive
overhead when a column with small vectors was used.
<LI>A major development is the new storage manager IncrementalStMan,
which replaces the StManMirAIO storage manager. This storage manager
is useful for columns containing slowly varying data. Only the
changes are stored resulting in a very space-efficient storage
mechanism for such columns. Unlike StManMirAIO it keeps only a
limited amount of data in memory (in a BucketCache object) resulting
in less memory usage.

<FONT SIZE=2>In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we did continue the
development of the polarization deconvolution and selfcalibration
task, adding a simple user interface based upon the Tasking design,
and a GUI based upon Glishtk. We did continue development of simulation
software for testing and verification, but not at the level anticipated.
We did finish the WSRT filler into the MeasurementSet and perform
some trial reductions of WSRT data. Due to the ongoing work with
the Measures system, we did not write new tools for gridding and
fast Fourier transformation of visibility data. We did not begin
an investigation of the adaptation of the synthesis code to parallel
