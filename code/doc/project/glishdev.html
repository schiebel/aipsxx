<a name=introduction><H2>Introduction</H2>
This document describes the development planned for the Glish language as
part of the <A HREF="../html/aips++.html">AIPS++</A>
project. Glish is a public domain language which was developed as part of the 
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.gov/">SSC</A> project
at <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory</A>. The primary
authors of Glish were Vern Paxson (<em>vern@ee.lbl.gov</em>) and 
Chris Saltmarsh (<em>salty@farpoint.co.uk</em>). Most of the
Glish funding 
<A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/./Science-Articles/Archive/ssc-and-future.html">died</A>
with the SSC, and as a result, it currently has no solid support. Besides AIPS++, the only
other group currently working on Glish is the
<A HREF="http://acnsun10.rhic.bnl.gov/RHIC/">RHIC</A> project at
<A HREF="http://www.bnl.gov/">Brookhaven National Laboratory</A>. The primary
person at BNL working on Glish is Todd Satogata (<em>satogata@bnl.gov</em>).
Most of the work Todd seems to be doing is work on the lower levels of Glish,
e.g. communications and client interaction.
<p>
The AIPS++ project is primarily concerned with the <em>language aspects</em> of
Glish because while some communications level changes will be required, e.g.
persistent clients, the weakest link in Glish from the AIPS++ perspective is the
expressiveness and the user friendliness of the language. This is a direct
result of Glish's lineage. It was constructed as a simple scripting language
for control system work. While the language is loosely based on <b>S</b>, it
has not been used enough as a programming language to round out some of the
language rough spots. This is where most of the AIPS++ changes have been and will
continue to be made.
<p>
This document attempts to organize the future direction of Glish development
within AIPS++ in two ways. First, the <a href="#logical-dev">logical
development</a> section lays out the  of tasks which are planned for Glish. 
In this section, logically related changes are grouped together.
This provides a view of
where AIPS++ plans to take Glish. However, while this presents the entire
development in a way most accessible for readers, it does not present the
development in a way convenient for management planning. This is because for planning
one is interested in only in task ordering and dependence. This is laid out
in the second <a href="#phased-dev">planning section</a>. That section lists the
project mile-stones in which Glish will participate along with the Glish functionality
required at that point. This will hopefully provide a simple way for people to look
at what is being done to Glish and when it is targeted to be done. This will also
provide the tie-in to other development plans.
</a>
<HR>

<a name=logical-dev><H2>Logical Development</H2></a>

<a name=user-interaction><H3>User Interaction</H3></a>
By <em>user interaction</em> we mean the aspect of Glish which the user typing
at the keyboard notices. This involves things like robustness (in the face of
bad input), response time, command line editing, uncomfortable syntax, etc. This
is probably the aspects of Glish that 90% of the users will see, and the changes
which this section suggests are intended to prevent users from cursing at these
aspects of Glish. In many cases, these changes will be both the easiest to make and
may have the most impact on how well users like the Glish CLI.

<H4>Required Changes</H4>
<p> <a name=history>
A <strong>longer history buffer</strong> <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> is required because
currently it is very
short (last 20 commands). It would also be worth while to look at how the search
capability works in order to try to make it nicer and easy to use. It currently
has problems with lines which are longer than a single line. This is a lesser
concern, however. In addition to an internal history, it is important
to have the ability to log commands to a <strong>history log file</strong>. This
will allow users to view and re-execute portions of a previous session. The ability
to keep a history log is essential.</a>
<p> <a name=func-completion>
Having a facility for <strong>function name completion</strong> will be very important
because much of the way novice users will interact from the CLI with AIPS++ supplied
Glish clients will be through function wrappers. As a result, some way of doing
function/variable name completion will probably make users' lives much more bearable. </a>
<p> <a name=shell-escape>
Currently in Glish there is no way to <strong>escape to the user's shell</strong>. At
times, it is important to be able to get to the shell to do some simple operations
before returning to Glish with all of its previous state. In addition, 
<strong>^Z</strong> does not currently work as a result on command line editing.
For a user friendly environment, one or both of these capabilities should be
added. </a>
<p> <a name=array-dump>
Arrays which are printed in Glish print all of the elements of the array 
regardless of the array length. This can be a major problem (as any user who has
accidentally printed an array and then waited for minutes while the whole array was
dumped to the screen can attest). Some mechanism must be added to Glish to allow 
for specifying <strong>limits for dumping arrays to the screen</strong>. <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"></a>
<p> <a name=ctrl-c>
Currently typing <b>^C</b> cause Glish to exit. It would be nice if instead of simply
exiting Glish would return to the toplevel command interface, i.e. stop function
evaluation, file inclusion, etc. A second <b>^C</b> would then cause Glish to
exit.<IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">
<p> <a name=testing>
Probably the most important change which will affect the robustness of Glish is the
creation of a <strong>Glish test suite</strong>. Having a test suite will allow
Glish to be checked after changes and after ports to new architectures. As such, a
test suite would be useful to both users and Glish developers. This is <em>very</em>
important and has been neglected for too long.</a>


<H4>Possible (Non-)Features</H4>
<a name="rid-:=">
Many people have suggested <strong>getting rid of :=</strong>. This should be
examined, and its feasibility assessed. Replacing the assignment operator ':=' with
'=' is complicated by the fact that '=' is used for other things in Glish syntax. </a>
<p> <a name=sexagesimal>
There are reasons to consider adding <strong>sexagesimal notation</strong> to Glish.
The primary reason for adding it to Glish is that its use would be much more natural
if it was actually a part of Glish rather than being handled by a function or preprocessor.
The reason not to added it to Glish is the fact that it is very specific to astronomy.
It could be <em>#ifdef</em>ed or perhaps there is a general way to add new notations
to Glish. In any event, this possibility should be considered. </a>
<p> <a name=funcname>
Another user suggestion is to change <b>function usage</b> so that the name of the function
results in the value for functions with no parameters, e.g.
<pre>
    func offset() { ... }
    newval := 23 * offset / 30;
</pre>
This would result in cleaner function usage within expressions, in some cases.</a>
<p> <a name=vi>
Some users have requested <b>vi</b> editing syntax in addition to Emacs editing
commands. This is probably a good idea. However, it should be done in a way which
is not confusing to users, e.g. not mixing to two command sets.</a>
<p> <a name=units>
One other possible (and interesting) thing which could be added to Glish and which
may be useful for users is a system for specifying <strong>units within Glish</strong>.
This would allow the users to specify unit relationships and set the units for
Glish values. Glish would then verify the unit compatibility as the values were used.
While this may be useful, it is probably difficult to get right and it may not be
well used; however, it should be kept in mind and is listed here in that spirit.</a>

<a name=programmability><H3>Programmability</H3></a>
The end users of the AIPS++ Glish CLI are likely to do little serious programming in
the language. However, those developing AIPS++ and the expert end users are likely to
do quite a lot of programming in the Glish language. It is important that all of the
facilities necessary for modular design and development are available in Glish. Because
some of these changes are fundamental to Glish, they must be made carefully, and because
some are difficult to make, it will take some time for these changes to be made.
<p> <a name=packages>
The feature most lacking in Glish with respect to programmability is some <strong>module
or package system</strong> which will allow programmers to segment portions of the name
space. This is important because currently it is very easy for users to redefine 
<em>system</em> functions or variables. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that
all variables and functions within Glish share the same name space. It is important that
this extension be developed sooner rather than later because packages should be used as
AIPS++ subsystems are constructed instead of some <em>ad hoc</em> name mangling scheme.
</a>
<p> <a name=constness>
In addition, some form of <strong>const-ness</strong> is also probably required<IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">. This may
be required for packages, individual values, or both. However, since many constants
are likely to be required, e.g. <em>PI</em>, it is likely that one would like to be
able to assign const-ness at the individual value level. </a>
<p> <a name=include-path>
Another glaring problem is the lack of a way to specify an <strong>include path</strong>
<IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> for
including Glish script files. This is a problem because it requires that either Glish
must be run from the same directory relative to the included files or else the full path
must be given. This makes Glish script fragile and difficult to share.</a> Another related
feature which was requested was the ability to specify <strong>load files</strong>
<IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> on the command line, via e.g. a "-l" flag, before the interactive
session was started.
<p> <a name=debugability>
Currently it is very difficult to debug Glish scripts. Scripts are simply included and
Glish's error messages give no indication where the error occurred. The long term solution
to this problem is to develop a <strong>symbolic debugger</strong> for Glish. This is a
difficult proposition, but if Glish is to be successful as a programming language in the
long term, a debugger will be required. Another possibility is to have a mechanism which
will force Glish to <strong>echo each executed line</strong>. While this sort of 
<em>echo</em> is really a short term solution, it may continue to be of some use even
after a debugger is developed. Another way to improve debugability is to at least provide
a <strong>stack dump</strong> <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> when an error is encountered. </a>
<p> <a name=localscope>
Variables which are used in Glish functions are global by default and to make them local
they must be explicitly declared as <em>local</em>. This should be changed so that
variables are <strong>local by default</strong><IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">. This is a basic principle of scoping
which Glish should be changed to follow. Having the default scope be the most local
scope available will reduce programmer error and highlight those places where a function
is using <em>global</em> variables. </a>
<p> <a name=oop>
Object oriented programming is a very useful way to encapsulate reusable pieces of a
system. While Glish shouldn't be turned into an object oriented system, capabilities
should be added which <strong>facilitate object oriented programming</strong>. AIPS++
programmers will develop object oriented applications in C++, and to some degree, they should be able
to carry this skill over to programming the CLI. While Glish values could be used as
the basis for <em>objects</em> in Glish given the existence of attributes, the
granularity values is probably too small a granularity. Packages, once implemented,
should form a more
appropriate granularity for object oriented development than values. 
Care must be exercised in adding object oriented features as a result of the interactive
nature of Glish. Trying to mirror a compiled
language, like C++, in Glish would be a mistake; Perl 5.0 provides a better example
of the direction object oriented capabilities should go. </a><a name=shut-down>In this same
vein, one of the nice features of object oriented languages is the notion of destructors.
These functions allow an <em>object</em> to clean up all of the loose ends before exiting.
It may also be useful to have a <em>global</em> <strong>shut-down function</strong>. This
hook would allow global resources to be cleaned up before Glish exits. This shut down
function would be useful in addition to <em>object</em> destructors. The issues involved
with object oriented programming should be borne in mind while packages are designed
and implemented. </a>
<p> <a name=glishrc>
A minor but useful change is this addition of an <strong>installation wide .glishrc</strong>
<IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> file. This allows a particular site to add some
customization for a particular site. This is most useful for setting the
<a href="#include-path">include path</a> for Glish scripts installed at a given site. </a>
<p> <a name=typing>
In the long term view, function and event typing should be considered for Glish. Typing
helps identify bugs at parse-time rather than during execution. Typing would be useful
for functions, <em>whenever</em> statements, and within the <em>Client</em> class. Typing
in its simplest form would simply allow the user to specify, for example, that a function
(or event) is expected to be numeric. While much more complicated typing schemes are
possible, typing in Glish should be kept as simple as possible given Glish's interactive
nature.</a>
<p> <a name=eval>
The final tool which could be very useful for programmers is an <strong>eval
command</strong> <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">. This would allow the Glish interpreter to evaluate strings
as input to the Gish interpreter. Other languages have this,
e.g. Lisp, Perl, etc., and this will probably be important for some AIPS++
applications</a>
<a name=client-interaction><H3>Client Interaction</H3></a>
There are some capabilities which will be important for building distributed
applications. This section is separated from the previous because, while these
client capabilities affect the programmer's environment, these changes are more
related to what goes on behind the scenes to make Glish a nice environment for
developing distributed applications. These changes are related to the Glish
support structure.
<p> <a name=persistent-clients>
The primary short coming with respect to clients in Glish is the lack of 
<strong>persistent clients</strong><IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">. It is very important
for the AIPS++
effort to have the ability to have long-lived clients which users (via
Glish) can connect to and disconnect from at will. The details of how this
should work have not yet been worked out, but the need for such a capability
is evident. Another similar thing which might be important in the future is
<strong>interconnected Glishes</strong>. It may be important to have one
Glish bus running controlling data collection at a telescope, for example,
and another Glish bus controlling the near-realtime analysis. In the ideal
case, these would be two separate Glishes, but they would interact to allow
the data to be received in the analysis bus as it becomes available on the
collection bus. There are two different aspects to the latter scenario. The
first is the act of attaching to a persistent client, e.g. the analysis Glish
attaching to the collection Glish, and the second is the case of having an
<strong>unexpected client</strong> join a pre-existing Glish, e.g. the collection
Glish having a new client (the analysis Glish) attempt to attach. Both of these
capabilities are probably important.
<p> <a name=event-timeout>
The final aspect of Glish client interaction which is important but is currently
missing from Glish is the ability to specify a <strong>time out for expected
events</strong>. This capability would allow for a time out on <em>request</em>
and <em>await</em> statements. This would allow a Glish system to recover from
the AWOL event. Currently the whole system freezes in a catatonic state. </a>
<a name="efficiency&amp;security"><H3>Efficiency and Security</H3></a>
<p> <a name=efficiency>
Finally, there are a couple of efficiency concerns. The first is <strong>gratuitous
promotion to double</strong>. Many functions, for the sake of simplicity, promote
floats to doubles. This promotion could be both deceiving and expensive, essentially
doubling array size. </a>
<p> <a name="copy-on-write">
The second efficiency concern is related to the confusing semantics of <em>const/ref</em>.
It is desirable to replace the current <em>const/ref</em> scheme, which was created mainly
for efficient passing of parameters, with a <strong>copy on write</strong> <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif"> mechanism
which would maintain a references to the underlying data, and only do the copy when
a write is done to the data. This will not only provide a more coherent semantics, but
it will probably also be more efficient. </a>
<p> <a name="glishd">
There are currently two related (known) security problems in Gish (glishd in particular).
 The first relates to <a name="glishd-authentication"><strong>authentication</strong><IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">. 
<em>glishd</em> does not attempt to authenticate users and hosts with which it communicates.
To prevent this, <em>glishd</em> needs to attempt to authenticate the hosts and users who connect
to it. Any scheme will likely require keys for users and hosts.</a>
<p><a name="glishd-ownership">
The second related problem is one of <strong>glishd ownership</strong>. Currently only one
<em>glishd</em> daemon is created per host, this daemon controls remote Glish clients on that
host. The problem is that even if user and host are authenticated these <em>valid</em> users
are still connecting to a daemon which may have been created previously by another user. As a
result, clients which are created and commands which are executed run under the <em>uid</em>
of the person who originally started the <em>glishd</em>. These <em>glishd security problem</em>
must be fixed before Glish is used publicly. </a> </a>

<a name=gbt-julytest><H3>GBT Tests <em>July 1995</em></H3></a>
Glish will be used as a part of both the analysis and the control software for the
GBT tests, but I don't believe any of the additions are <em>required</em> for these
tests. However, it would be nice to have the following features added:
<ul>
<li> First incarnation of <a href="#packages">packages</a>
<li> <a href="#include-path">Include path</a> handling <IMG ALT="(DONE)" SRC="../gif/done.gif">
</ul>
Again, neither of these are required, but they would make the analysis code more
convenient and portable. In addition, it would provide a place to start developing
a module system.
