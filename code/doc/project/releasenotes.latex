\section{Purpose}

This document is a guide for beta testers of AIPS++ release 0.9. It is
intended to describe the installation procedures, outline the current
capabilities of AIPS++, and to describe what feedback we would like
from beta testers.

The content of this document is close to that of the 
\htmladdnormallink{release notes}{\releasenotesURL}
for AIPS++ release 0.8. The main changes are to describe the new
functionality.

\section{Planned releases of AIPS++}

It is important to understand the role of this beta release in the
development of AIPS++.  The AIPS++ release process has been described
in a document on \htmladdnormallink{Planning for Releases of
AIPS++}{\betaURL}. AIPS++ is continuing development at the various
\htmladdnormallink{AIPS++ consortium sites}{\consortiumURL}, and
rapidly evolving versions of the AIPS++ system are to be found at the
consortium sites. A release is a snapshot of the development system
that is suitable for export to other sites. We plan to make two major
releases, one in 1997 and one in 1998. The first is designated as a
``Limited Public Release'' since it will contain only a subset of the
functionality expected to be present eventually. The second release,
in 1998, is expected to have a more rounded set of capabilities. Both
of these will be preceded by explicit ``beta'' releases. The release
described here is is the second beta release: AIPS++ Version 0.9. The
expected set of releases are thus:

\begin{description}
\item{AIPS++ V0.8: beta release (issued February 26 1997)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Targeted to consortium sites and a few friendly astronomers
\item Contains basic environment, tools, synthesis applications.
\end{itemize}
\item{AIPS++ V0.9: beta release}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rectify problems from V0.8
\item Add spectral line functionality to synthesis processing
\item Other tools 
\end{itemize}
\item{AIPS++ V0.95: beta release}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rectify problems from V0.9
\item Preview GUI for feedback before release
\end{itemize}
\item{AIPS++ V1.0: Limited Public Release} Due late 1997
\begin{itemize}
\item Open release, targeted to astronomers and perhaps programmers
\item Contains basic environment, tools, synthesis applications.
\item GUI frontends to major Distributed Objects and applications
\item Interfaces should be fixed at this point,
\item Will provide environment for code development.
\end{itemize}
\item{AIPS++ V2.0} Due late 1998
\begin{itemize}
\item Full synthesis package (including some functionality for VLBI)
\item Single dish package
\item Image Analysis package
\item General toolkit
\item Visualization toolkit and applications
\item Contributed code
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

We use the term beta release to denote a distribution of the system to
a limited number of people who have agreed to test the system and
report problems and general comments.  The principal goals of the beta
releases and the LPR are to provide astronomers with a first look at
functionality in a number of different areas: synthesis, image
analysis, general tool-kit, and for the AIPS++ Project to get
experience with distribution and support of AIPS++ outside consortium
sites.

More specific description of what we expect to learn from beta-testers
is given below. First, we describe the current capabilities of AIPS++
and how to install it.

\section{Current capabilities of AIPS++}

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the capabilities
of AIPS++, describing both what is present in the system, and what we
have not yet delivered.

\subsection{What is present}

\begin{itemize}
\item All user capabilities of AIPS++ are documented via the
\htmladdnormallink{AIPS++ User Reference Manual}{\userrefmanualURL}.
\item The heart of AIPS++ is a powerful command line interpreter
called Glish (see Appendix A for copyright information). Glish has both a
\htmladdnormallink{tutorial}{\GlishtutorialURL} and a
\htmladdnormallink{reference manual}{\GlishmanualURL}.
\item AIPS++ has a number of general purpose tools that are accessible
from Glish.
\begin{itemize}
\item Access to all data in AIPS++ via the \htmlref{{\tt table}}{table} 
module.
\item Catalogs of directories, interpreting the contents to show 
different types of files, and catalogs of potentially everything in Glish
({\em i.e.} functions and variables).
\item Plotting of Glish variables.
\item Assorted mathematical capabilities such as 
statistics, random numbers, polynomial fitting, interpolation,
Fast Fourier Transforms and convolutions.
\item Manipulation of measured quantities with units and reference
frames either from the Glish command line or via a gui.
\item Display of AIPS++ or FITS images or Glish arrays using the
aipsview program.
\item Conversion of images to and from FITS image format, 
reading and writing AIPS++ images to and from Glish. Statistics, histograms and 
moments of images may be calculated. Subimaging and padding are both allowed.
\item Logging of messages to a gui window and a table, also printing
to a postscript printer or to ghostview.
\item Miscellaneous useful utilities including: obtaining AIPS++ 
configuration information, the \htmlref{{\tt help}}{utility:help} utility, 
a printer tool (including a gui), execution of shell commands, reading and 
writing to external files using C-like commands, {\em etc.}
\end{itemize}
\item The synthesis capabilities of AIPS++ are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Filling from and writing to a UVFITS file,
\item Filling from WSRT format,
\item Full imaging, deconvolution, and self-calibration,
\item Joint deconvolution of Stokes IQUV,
\item Robust, uniform and natural weighting,
\item Flexible windowing in the deconvolution,
\item Non-Negative Least Squares Deconvolution,
\item Flexible construction of models for self-calibration,
\item A sophisticated multi-component model for gain effects,
\item Interactive editing,
\item Flagging of gain solutions by antenna, spectral window, and
time interval.
\item Writing of final images to FITS files.
\item Spectral line synthesis processing
\end{itemize}

More details of the synthesis capabilities can
be found from the documentation on the \htmlref{imager}{imager}, and
from the \htmladdnormallink{Guide to Synthesis Processing in AIPS++}
{../../user/Synthesis}.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{What isn't present}

\begin{itemize}
\item GUI interfaces. These are under development.
\item Fully-fledged synthesis {\em cross-}calibration is deferred until the major
release (V1.0) in 1998. Self-calibration is present in AIPS++ V0.8 and V0.9.
\item Efficient processing of large synthesis images. Current processing
is optimized towards spectral-line observations.
\item Single dish processing.
\item A cookbook.
\item We do not expect people to program at the C++ level using the
beta release. If you really want to do this, please contact us
separately. It can be arranged but is not supported as part of
the beta release.
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation of AIPS++}

We assume that you are installing a Beta release of the system,
complete with prebuilt binaries.  You need to refer to other
documentation if you are attempting an installation from source; such
is beyond the scope of this document.

Installation over the top of a existing version is possible but
you may wish to make a new installation.

\subsection{Before installation}

If you have an existing installation, we recommend that you write
existing MeasurementSets and Images to FITS format from where
they can be reloaded.

\subsection{What will the installation do?}

The installation process involves you downloading several compressed
(GNU-zipped) tar files from the {\tt aips2.nrao.edu} anonymous ftp server,
and running an install script (called {\tt configure}).  It will
uncompress and unpack these tar files in the right places, and you will
end up with a complete source-and-binary AIPS++ system, ready to run.  
All that will be required is the invocation of an initialization script
({\tt aipsinit.sh} or {\tt aipsinit.csh}) which you can call for
convenience in your {\tt .login} or {\tt .profile} or equivalent login
script.

\subsection{Requirements}

This beta release is targeted at a few architectures:

\begin{description}
\item[{\tt sun4sol\_gnu}] Sparc systems running SunOS 5 
\item[{\tt linux\_gnu}] Intel Pentium or Pentium Pro machines
running Linux
\end{description}

We use the GNU C++ compiler to generate the binaries. You do not need to
have the GNU compiler, however, as prebuilt binaries and libraries are
provided.

While a separate account for AIPS++ is recommended, it is not required for
the installation.  Your own personal account --- assuming sufficient disk
space --- should suffice.  You will not need {\tt root} access, and should
{\it not\/} perform the installation as {\tt root}.  In addition, you will
not be required to gain access to any operating system files or
directories; everything can be done from a normal, non-privileged account.

AIPS++ uses the Caltech
\htmladdnormallink{PGPLOT}{http://astro.caltech.edu/\~{}tjp/pgplot}
package (version 5.1.0 or later) to provide various plotting
capabilities. If you already have an installation of PGPLOT, then you
can and should use that.  Otherwise, for convenience we provide a copy
of the PGPLOT library and the required font file, grfont.dat. Please
note that PGPLOT is not public-domain software. However, it is freely
available for non-commercial use. It is copyrighted by California
Institute of Technology.

Here is an approximate outline of the various hardware and software
{\bf requirements} for this release:

\begin{itemize}
\item Sparcstation IPX-class or better, preferably at least Sparc-20,
      or a Pentium class machine.
\item SunOS 5, ideally SunOS 5.5 (a.k.a. Solaris 2.5) or higher; or Linux
      2.0 or 2.1. We expect distributions for HPUX, SGI and Dec Alpha
      (OSF1) to follow). 
\item 64 Megabytes of memory (32 is workable but your system will be
	swapping most of the time)
\item At least 250 Megabytes of disk space (not counting space for data)
\item At least 100 Megabytes of swap space
\end{itemize}

While this is a minimum list, you may also want to include these optional
items:

\begin{itemize}
\item The
\htmladdnormallink{PGPLOT}{http://astro.caltech.edu/\~{}tjp/pgplot} 
        library and font file ({\tt grfont.dat}).  These are
	supplied in the binary distribution, but if you already have
	version 5.1.0 or better, you should make sure your {\tt
	PGPLOT\_FONT} and/or {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variables
	are set up for it.
\item The {\tt libtcl7.6.so} shared library.  A copy is provided in the
	binary distribution.
\item A copy of {\tt gunzip}.  The {\tt configure} script will offer to
	download and install a version for you if you do not already have
	it (or you can retrieve the version available in the
	\htmladdnormallink{Classic AIPS}{ftp://aips.nrao.edu/aips/}
	anonymous ftp directories).
        %%% it would be nice for us to make this automatic...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fetching the stuff}

\begin{enumerate}
\item You will want to create an ``aips root'' directory for AIPS++, much
      as many of you have done in the past for \htmladdnormallink{Classic
      AIPS}{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/}.  Create a {\tt code}
      subdirectory underneath this AIPS++ root area, and {\tt cd} to this
      subdirectory.
\item Retrieve all source savesets via \htmladdnormallink{anonymous
      ftp}{ftp://aips2.nrao.edu/pub/RELEASED/aips++0.9/} from the server
      {\tt aips2.nrao.edu} in directory
      {\tt /pub/RELEASED/aips++0.9/}.  These should include at a minimum:
      \begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt README} (read it for last-minute changes)
	\item {\tt VERSION} (the version of AIPS++ you're getting)
	\item {\tt configure} (the installation script)
	\item {\tt aips-09.001.tar.gz} (The core of AIPS++, source code)
      % \item {\tt dish-09.001.tar.gz} (Single dish source)
	\item {\tt doc-09.001.tar.gz} (Documentation source)
	\item {\tt docs-09.001.tar.gz} (Documentation)
	\item {\tt install-09.001.tar.gz} (Installation infrastructure)
	\item {\tt nfra-09.001.tar.gz} (NFRA specific code)
      % \item {\tt synthesis-09.001.tar.gz} (Synthesis imaging source
      %		code)
	\item {\tt trial-09.001.tar.gz} (trial, where most of the
		interesting stuff is to be found)
      % \item {\tt vlbi-09.001.tar.gz} (VLBI source code)
      \end{enumerate}
      and make sure you leave them in your {\tt code/} subdirectory.
      % should insert sizes, and maybe md5sums here.

\item Retrieve the binary archive from the same ftp server in the same
      directory.  This will be either:
      \begin{enumerate}
	\item {\tt bin-sun4sol\_gnu-09.001.tar.gz} for Solaris systems, or
	\item {\tt bin-linux\_gnu-09.001.tar.gz} for Linux/Intel systems.
      \end{enumerate}
       Place it in your {\tt code} subdirectory also. If you are using
      some other architecture, replace the architecture name ({\it
      e.g.\/}, {\tt sun4sol\_gnu}) in the above 
      filename with the relevant architecture ({\it e.g.\/}, get {\tt 
      bin-alpha\_gnu-09.001.tar.gz}). We will have {\tt sun4sol}
      and {\tt linux} available at the release, and others shortly
      thereafter; these may include {\tt DEC}, {\tt HP} and {\tt SGI} 
      depending on demand. 

\item Make sure the configure script is executable ({\tt chmod +x
      configure}). 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Running the configure script}

\subsubsection{Preliminaries}

Before you plunge in and start the installation, you may want to make some
preparations.  First, if you have a local copy of {\tt gunzip}, make sure
your {\tt PATH} environment variable includes the directory where it is
found.  If it does not by default, you can add it like this (if your shell
is one of {\tt sh}, {\tt bash}, {\tt ksh}, {\tt zsh} or some other
bourne-like shell):\par

%%% Don't want to really use description here, but I'm a TeX-er not a
%%% LaTeX-er and don't know the equivalent of:
%%% \def\example#1{{\line{\hskip 2cm {\tt #1} \hfill}}}

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt PATH=\$\{PATH\}:/wherever/bin; export PATH}
\end{description}

\noindent or if your shell is {\tt csh}, {\tt tcsh} or another C-like
shell:\par

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt setenv PATH \$\{PATH\}:/wherever/bin}
\end{description}


\noindent In the above examples, it is presumed that {\tt gunzip} is found
in the directory {\tt /wherever/bin/gunzip}.

Another variable you may wish to add to the {\tt PATH} variable is the
location of your X11 or OpenWindows software.  On Sun systems, this will
typically be in {\tt /usr/openwin}:\par

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt OPENWINHOME=/usr/openwin; export OPENWINHOME}
                   \item[]{\tt PATH=\$\{PATH\}:\$OPENWINHOME/bin}
\end{description}

\noindent or for C-shells:\par

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt setenv OPENWINHOME /usr/openwin}
                   \item[]{\tt setenv PATH \$\{PATH\}:\$OPENWINHOME/bin}
\end{description}

If you have an existing \htmladdnormallink{Classic
AIPS}{http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/} installation, you may want to ensure
that you have defined its environment via the {\tt LOGIN.SH} or {\tt
LOGIN.CSH} scripts first.  This will cause the {\tt configure} script
for AIPS++ to automatically generate a hosts database from the existing
AIPS information in {\tt HOSTS.LIST}, which can be a real timesaver.

Finally, if you have a favourite text editor (emacs, vi, textedit, elvis,
{\it etc\/}.), you should make sure that either the {\tt EDITOR} or {\tt
VISUAL} environment variables are set to invoke it, {\it e.g.\/}, \par

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt VISUAL=/usr/local/bin/emacs; export VISUAL}
\end{description}

\noindent or:\par

\begin{description}\item{\tt setenv VISUAL /usr/local/bin/emacs}
\end{description}

\noindent as appropriate for your shell.

\subsubsection{Running the configure script}

Make sure you are in the {\tt code} subdirectory where you left the
GNU-zipped tar files, and enter this on your Unix command line:\par

\begin{description}\item[]{\tt ./configure}
\end{description}

\noindent Then answer the questions, which are fairly routine.  The steps
you have to go through for this installation are actually fewer and less
complex than the equivalent ({\tt INSTEP1}) for Classic AIPS, so don't
panic.\par

The first thing you'll see is something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
   The 'configure' script bootstraps the AIPS++ system to a state
   where it can be used by end-users.  It will by default perform
   a binary installation, but it can be used to recursively build
   the libraries, executables, and other parts of the system.
   
   It may be used to configure AIPS++ from scratch, or to add a
   new architecture.  In the latter case the installation of the
   aipsinit scripts and databases can be skipped.
   
   You will be asked a few simple questions, most of which have
   default answers (in square brackets).  Simply type <return> to
   accept these defaults.
\end{verbatim}

If you are reading this document, then you are doing a binary
installation, you are not configuring from scratch, and you are not adding
a new architecture.  If you have previously defined an {\tt EDITOR} or
{\tt VISUAL} environment variable, you will see a notice to the effect
that {\tt configure} found this, and will use it to let you edit a few
critical files along the way.

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf AIPSROOT}: This is shorthand for the top-level AIPS++
      directory (the one in which you created the {\tt code}
      subdirectory); the script will ask you to verify its correctness.
      If for some reason the {\tt configure} script guesses it
      incorrectly, please enter the correct full directory name here.  If
      you do not run the script from the {\tt \$AIPSROOT/code} directory,
      you will be prompted to move there and restart the script.

\item {\bf Optional Utilities}: For a full-blown AIPS++ consortium
      installation, there are a certain number of utilities needed to make
      it fully functional; these will be listed now, and instructions will
      be presented in case you want to install any of them later.  They
      are {\it not required\/} for the binary installation, unless you
      plan on doing code development within the AIPS++ system.

\item {\bf Required Utilities}: For the from-source installation, some
      third party utilities are required.  Only one of these is needed for
      the binary installation,
      %%% make sure this is still true!  Check the code/install/configure
      %%% script... 
      namely {\tt gzip} (techincally, only {\tt gunzip} is needed but both
      usually come as a package).  If {\tt configure} finds {\tt gzip} in
      your {\tt PATH}, it assumes all is well and skips on to the next
      section.  Otherwise it offers to download, build and install the
      utility for you.  Note that root or superuser access is not
      required, as it will place the {\tt gzip} {\it etc\/}. binaries it
      builds into a relevant AIPS++ directory.

\item {\bf Extract Compressed tar files}: As requested by various
      potential users and other interested parties, the beta release for
      AIPS++ is including sources as well as the binaries.  The existence
      of the source files is not required to be able to run the system.
      However, some source level packages --- such as the install {\tt
      tar.gz} saveset --- are required.  In any event, {\tt configure}
      will unpack each GNU-zipped tar file you have placed in the {\tt
      code} subdirectory automatically.  It has a manual override so that
      you can, for example, choose not to delete the tar files once they
      are unpacked. 

\item {\bf Install Binaries}: This step is essentially identical to the
      previous one, except that the binaries and libraries needed to run
      AIPS++ are unpacked for each architecture you have selected.  For
      the early beta releases, the most tested architectures are
      {\tt sun4sol\_gnu}  and {\tt linux\_gnu} (these correspond to
      Sparc systems running SunOS 5/Solaris 2 with the GNU
      {\tt g++} compiler, and Linux on Intel platforms also with the GNU
      compiler; though you do not need the compiler to run
      the AIPS++ binaries). However other architecures will be available
      at or near release (see the previous section on ``Fetching the
      stuff''). 

\item {\bf Install aipsinit}: In every AIPS++ installation, there is a
      shell script that one ``sources'' or invokes to define the
      environment necessary to run the system.  The {\tt configure} script
      automatically sets these files ({\tt aips\-init.csh} and {\tt
      aipsinit.sh}) up for you.

\item {\bf Construct aipshosts}: The AIPS++ system is flexible enough to
      permit you to alter its setup in a per-host, per-architecture, and
      per-site manner.  In order to do this, it needs to know the name and
      architecture of each computer in your AIPS++ site.  To achieve this,
      a text file called {\tt aipshosts} will be created in the {\tt
      AIPSROOT} directory.  This is the exact equivalent of the Classic
      AIPS {\tt HOSTS.LIST} file, and in fact the {\tt configure} script
      will attempt to use the information in the latter if it is found.
      If you elect not to use this info (or if it's not present or found),
      you will be asked for a site name, the architecture, and a
      description of the current host and each additional host you want to
      add to the AIPS++ site. 

\item {\bf Fetch patches/bug fixes}: {\it If you are installing for the
      first time you can ignore this item\/}.

      If you already have a binary
      installation and you wish to install a new patch you should merely
      need to fetch the latest bin- and docs- (note! plural) .tar.gz files
      and untar them from the {\tt code} directory.  Be sure to
      temporarily undo any ``noclobber'' setting in your shell to allow
      replacement of files by the (un)tar command.  The source files will
      be out of date, however for a binary installation this should be
      fine. If you want the sources to be current as well, it is
      probably best for you to reinstall from scratch.

\item {\bf Construct aips++local file}: The purpose of this file is as an
      aid to the {\tt aips++} command, so that local definitions of, {\it
      e.g.}\/, {\tt PGPLOT\_FONT} and {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} may be made
      to accomodate the PGPLOT and other libraries needed to run the
      AIPS++ binaries.  The {\tt configure} script will check for an
      existing {\tt PGPLOT\_FONT} definition, and in its absence set it to
      point at the AIPS++ -provided location for the PGPLOT {\tt
      grfont.dat} font file.  In addition, on Sun and Linux architectures,
      a definition or revision of the
%%%   EVIL, NASTY, WICKED!  USE AT YOUR PERIL!
      variable {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}
      will be made so that the {\tt pgplot} and {\tt tcl} shared libraries
      may be used (these are provided with the binary installation, though
      if you have local copies they will be used first).  You may have to
      edit this file to set or correct the value of this latter variable;
      in particular, you should make sure it includes the location of your
      X libraries ({\it e.g.\/}, {\tt /usr/openwin/lib} or 
      {\tt /usr/local/X11/lib}) and the library location of any local
      installation of PGPLOT.  Note that the variable should be a
      colon-delimited list of directories.

\item {\bf Construct aipsrc and makedefs}: For more generic parameters,
      these files are used.  The former generally specifies quantities
      such as the AIPS++ manager account name (this need not be a
      dedicated account) and the default printer and paper format (A4 or
      Letter), while the latter is generally only of interest if you
      intend on code development or building the system from source.  The
      {\tt configure} script will ask you to edit the site-specific {\tt
      aipsrc} file and gives instructions on what to change; there should
      not be much you need to edit (just check what {\tt configure} did).
      Hopefully the comments are clear enough to avoid any confusion.  The
      file must be edited, as {\tt configure} checks if the word {\tt
      DEFINE\_ME} has been removed from it before proceeding.
\end{enumerate}

At this point, you should have an AIPS++ installation that is ready for
testing.  

\subsubsection{Testing the installation}

To test the installation, use the \htmlref{assay}{utility:assay}
module:

\begin{verbatim}
.      /aips++/beta/aipsinit.sh       # For Bourne/Korn/Bash shells
source /aips++/beta/aipsinit.csh      # For C-like shells
aips++
- include 'assay.g'
- assay().trytests()
\end{verbatim}

This will run all registered test scripts in the system, and summarize
at the end which failed. The complete sequence should take about 20
minutes.

The final number printed will be the number that failed. If this is
zero, then the installation has passed the first test. If it is not,
then you need to determine which test failed and run it again {\em
e.g.} if {\tt imagertest} failed then do:

\begin{verbatim}
aips++
- include 'assay.g'
- assay().try('imagertest')
\end{verbatim}

If it is not clear why a particular test fails, then please contact us
using the mail exploder
\htmladdnormallink{aips2-beta@nrao.edu}{mailto:aips2-beta@nrao.edu}
(see below for more details).

If no tests failed then you are ready to move on to using the system.
At this point, it may be a good idea to re-read the document on
\htmladdnormallink{Getting Started in AIPS++}{\gsURL}, and decide
what you wish to try out.

\subsection{Things That Can Go Wrong}

\subsubsection{ld.so (shared library loader) problems}

The most likely source of error on systems that support it is an incorrect
value for the environment variable {\tt LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.  On Sun and
Linux systems, this variable specifies additional directories to search
for unresolved shared libraries referenced in the binaries.  Your site may
not have the various system and optional shared libraries in the same
places as we do, so the binaries we generate may need this variable set to
include some of your site-specific directories before you can run certain
programs, or the aips++ system itself.

The {\tt configure} script will attempt to figure out what is needed for
this variable, and it will set and/or extend it (possibly on multiple
lines) for you in the file {\tt sun4sol\_gnu/aips++local.sh} (replace {\tt
sun4sol\_gnu} with your architecture if needed); while it tries to figure
out the right settings, it may not be correct for your environment.
%%% perhaps a note about judicious use of ldd here?

If you find the value in this file incorrect, please change it to whatever
is correct for your system.  Note that if you do not have either PGPLOT or
TCL libraries on your system, this variable will need to include the AIPS++
architecture-specific library ({\it e.g.\/}, {\tt
\$AIPSROOT/sun4sol\_gnu/lib}) as that is where they will then be found.

\section{Feedback requested from beta testers}

The purpose of the beta release is two-fold: to determine and correct
bugs, problems and deficiencies in the current software, and to
solicit general comment and feedback on AIPS++. To be successful,
both require a considerable allocation of time and patience, and
so we would like to thank you for agreeing to be a tester.

AIPS++ is a totally new package and has many features and capabilities
that most astronomers will be unfamiliar with. It has been designed in
accord with the \htmladdnormallink{AIPS++ User Requirements}{\specsURL} to
have both canned algorithms and general purpose tools. The general flavor
of the package may may seem strange (and probably irritating!) at first.
Please give it a chance.  What you see here is undoubtedly rawer than what
the end-user will eventually encounter.  We do plan to add more
user-friendly interfaces as we gain experience in what people want.

We suggest that you first take time to read a number of key pieces of
documentation. Please remember to keep notes on the documentation that you
read: Is it clear?  Does it cover what you need to know?  Is there jargon
present?  Do the examples actually work?

Start by reading the document on {\it\htmladdnormallink{Getting Started in
AIPS++}{\gsURL}\/}, probably all of the easy track. Then you should be in
a good position to try out some of the examples in that document.

If that leaves you curious about Glish, then try the {\it
\htmladdnormallink{Glish tutorial}{\GlishtutorialURL}}. This document
contains a very good introduction to the use of Glish, and also
touchs on some more sophisticated uses of Glish.

If you are interested in synthesis processing, then we recommend that
you read the documentation on the \htmlref{imager}{imager} and the
{\it \htmladdnormallink{Guide to Synthesis Processing in AIPS++}
{\gsURL}\/}. \htmlref{imager}{imager} has a demonstration
(\htmlref{imagerdemo} {imager:imagerdemo}) and a test
(\htmlref{imagertest}{imager:imagertest}) that are both worth running.
After running these examples, you might want to read the introductory
material for imager again.

Another tool that is worth looking at in some detail is Wim Brouw's
\htmlref{measures}{measures} module. This handles conversions of
measured quantities with units and reference frames. For example, it
can be used to calculate the rising time of a source at a given 
observatory.

At this point, you should be ready to decide on a small project that
you might wish to pursue, perhaps synthesis imaging of some sort, or
processing of ascii table data using the table system, or simply image
display.

We suggest that as you proceed, you report bugs and ``features'' as
you find them using one of the various methods described in the
next section. We also need more general and wide-ranging reactions
to the software, but our experience with our testers so far is
that you should give the system a little time beforehand.

\section{How to get help on using AIPS++ and how to report bugs}

If you are having trouble doing something that you think the system
should do, and you've read the documentation, you can get a human to
help by sending a message to the AIPS++ Beta exploder {\tt
\htmladdnormallink{aips2-beta@nrao.edu}{mailto:aips2-beta@nrao.edu}}. This
mailing list will include all the beta testers, and members of the
AIPS++ Project. You should expect to receive advice from a member of
the Project within a day or less. If you see a message from one of the
other testers that you understand the answer to, please help us out
and reply. An
\htmladdnormallink{archive}{http://aips2.nrao.edu/aips++/mail/aips2-beta/index.html}
of all messages is available.

If you know what to do and it just doesn't work, then report a bug.
There are a number of ways of doing this. The easiest is to use the
{\tt bug()} command from inside AIPS++. The advantage of this approach
is that it gives us information we need about your environment. An
alternative and sometimes more straightforward approach is to use the
WWW interface to the \htmladdnormallink{AIPS++ Bug reporting
system.}{http://aips2.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/html/reportbug.html}  Please
also use this mechanism to request or suggest enhancements to the
current system. You can also review all existing bugs from the 
\htmladdnormallink{AIPS++ Gnats Page}{http://aips2.nrao.edu/cgi-bin/gnats_home.pl}.

Finally, if you are totally frustrated and everything else has failed,
contact Tim Cornwell (505 835 7333,
\htmladdnormallink{tcornwel@nrao.edu}{mailto:tcornwel@nrao.edu})
or Brian Glendenning (505 835 7347, 
\htmladdnormallink{bglenden@nrao.edu}{mailto:bglenden@nrao.edu})

\section{Known problems}

We are aware of the following problems:

\begin{description}
\item[gplot1d under Linux] Extra click needed to set focus. So, for example,
to set the Select option, you may have to click {\em twice} on the Select
button.
\end{description}

\section{Changes visible to users}

\subsection{Changes between 0.9.01 and 0.8.02}
%%% that said 0.8.01 and I think it was wrong; PPM 19970903.0232

There have been many changes:

\begin{description}

\item[Aipsview] Many improvements to facilitate control of the
     program. Can also provide flexible slicing through multidimensional
     images.  See the \htmladdnormallink{Aipsview Manual}{\AipsviewURL}
     for more information. 

\item[Glish] Now considerably more robust. It traps {\tt control C}, and
{\tt Control $\backslash$} will exit.

\item[Gridding] A serious gridding bug that could occur under some
     circumstances has been fixed.

\item[Hanning smoothing] Hanning smoothing and numerous small improvements
     have been made to the Glish/image interface.

\item[History] FITS history cards are now preserved for images.

\item[Image] Asynchronous execution is possible (as for other Distributed
Objects). Production of moments images is now possible.

\item[Image cache] The cache size for images could be too low, causing
     unnecessary I/O.

\item[imager] Many changes involving spectral line processing.
A demonstration of spectral line processing is available as {\tt
imagerspectraltest()}. There have been improvements to the speed of
all types of processing, and a number of changes to the
interface. Imager now traps errors more carefully, and can be
interrupted (by Control C) and restarted (by {\tt di.restart()}.
Filling of MeasurementSets is now possible from BIMA and WSRT
data sets.

\item[Large Events/Alpha] Glish could hang when sending very large
     events. Also a bug only affecting DEC Alphas has been fixed.

\item[Log Window] The log window now builds all at once rather than
     incrementally. 

\item[Messages] Some unnecessarily obscure messages have been eliminated
     or made less threatening.

\item[Spectral Cubes] The FITS/spectral axis interconversion is more
     robust now.  

\end{description}

\subsection{Changes between 0.8.02 and 0.8.01}
\begin{description}

\item[UVFITS] Some unusual UVFITS files (SOURCE random parameter but no
AIPS SU table, spaces in embedded spaces in the UU/VV/WW random
parameters) can now be read.

\item[visset.g] Editing was not updating data on disk correctly, and editing
was only active on the first call to edit.  The editing has been
reworked considerably in response to a number of bugs. The function
{\tt vissetdemo()} demonstrates the capabilities of visset.

\item[Glish] Numerous bugs in Glish have been fixed. 
See the bug-tracking web pages for details.

\item[Logging] Updating the log window from the log table is now much
faster. Multiple SEVERE errors will now go in the same window. Some
bugs have been fixed, and a global variable ``t'' is no longer
created.

\item[Measures] A sign error in radial velocity calculations
has been corrected. A change in the calculation of {\tt B1950->App}
conversions has been made (a change in the order of aberration and
precession corrections, and the details of elliptical aberration
corrections).

\item[Plotting]
Glish {\tt setprintcommand()} has been added to program the functionality
of the gplot1d {\tt File|Print} button.  For example, {\tt
setprintercommand("ghostview")} will cause ghostview to receive the
temporary output file. 

%%% this paragraph may need some discretionary hyphens...
Glish {\tt setprinter()} should no longer be used.  For backward
compatibility, the function
{\tt setprinter(<printerName>)} has the same effect as \\
{\tt setprintcommand("pri -P<printerName>")}.

Glish {\tt psprint()} now causes a dialog box from {\tt "printer.g"} to
appear to control printing for each plot.

{\tt gplot1d} will create its own private colormap if enough colors are
not available in the default colormap.  This may cause flashing when
moving the mouse between the plot window and other programs.  If you do not
want this behaviour, close the plot window, then close other applications
that use excessive colors ({\it e.g.}, Netscape), and reopen the plot
window. 

All boolean functions that were previously restricted to accepting the set
of strings ({\tt "on"}, {\tt "off"}, {\tt "true"}, {\tt "false"}, {\tt
"yes"}, {\tt "no"}) now also accept boolean or numeric values.  For scalar
values, the value zero is false, and all other numbers are true.

All plotter functions will now fail gracefully if any parameter is of an
unacceptable type.

\item[Catalog] catalog and gcatalog now use the standard bug
form. catalog will not crash when ``unusual'' files are in the
directory any more.

\item[Printing] The aipsrc variable {\tt printer.default} is now used if
no {\tt PRINTER} environment variable is set.

\item[table.g] A bug in the creation of zero-row tables has been corrected.

\item[DEC alpha] Numerous changes to allow the beta release to compile
with the latest version of Digital Unix have been made.

\item[Bug reporting] Glish will no longer crash in the bug-reporting
form when control-characters are entered.

\item[Documentation] Numerous clarifications and corrections have been
made to the documentation. GIF icon files for documents generated via
\LaTeX 2html are now obtained locally rather than over the network.

\item[Help] Help will now start up faster and it is be less picky
about the format of the strings it is given.

\item[aipsinit] If an architecure of type ``NONE'' is supplied for the
host ``DEFAULT'' initialization will be suppressed for hosts which are
not explicitly listed in the {\tt aipshosts} file.  The various
aipsinit scripts will work now when there are a lot of files in the
directory.

\item[Memory use] Memory used to access images will be smaller in some
circumstances. However much larger decreases in memory use will appear
in version 0.9.

\item[configure] The configure script should do better at finding the
correct timezone offset.

\end{description}

\subsection{Changes between 0.8.01 and 0.8.00}
\begin{description}

\item[Glish does not start]
A bug where glish could not create the necessary keys has been
fixed. This could make Glish unusable.

\item[Wrong times in log messages]
A bug which caused some log messages to not apply the timezone offset
has been fixed.

\item[Bug reading FITS images]
FITS images without any sky-plane astronomical coordinates could cause bus
errors in the FITS reader.

\item[Local help files broken]
Local help files sometimes did not display properly in a browser.
