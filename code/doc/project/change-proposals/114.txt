Statement of goals:

To adopt gcc 2.95.2 as the AIPS++ project compiler (currently egcs-1.1.2)

Proposed changes:

We have been waiting for Rational Purify support for gcc 2.95 since
the advent of the compiler in late July, 1999. The most recent Purify
release, version 5.2, supports GNU gcc 2.8.1, which dates from March,
1998. No new support has been added for a GNU compiler since Purify
4.4, which added support for gcc 2.8.1. There is no formal support for
the egcs compilers, released Dec 1997 through March 1999. AIPS++ debug
compilations under egcs 1.1.2 fail under many cases at present for
Purify.

We have addressed this by slowing our adoption of new GNU project
compilers, while waiting for Purify support. In addition, we have
relied on a secondary egcs 1.0.3a build, which is sufficiently
close to gcc 2.7.2 to work with Purify. 

There is now an accelerating divergence between the GNU compiler
release schedule (gcc 3.0 due late 2000), and GNU support in Purify.
It is appropriate at this point to break the linkage between these
two decisions as follows:

 - Adopt gcc 2.95.2 now as the project compiler for better standard
   compliance and compatibility with current and expected Linux
   releases we need to support. Note that gcc 2.96 and gcc 2.97
   are only development snapshots and will never form a release
   by GNU. This should preferably be done at the beginning of the
   current development cycle.

 - Drop egcs 1.0.3a as the secondary Purify compiler completely, and
   replace it with a compiler currently supported by Purify, SUN CC
   (4.0,5.0 depending on experience). See Note 237 for a description
   of project policies for secondary compilers, which currently
   include only SGI and egcs 1.0.3a. 

Expected Impact:

- Sites will need to install gcc 2.95.2, if they have not done so already.

- gcc 2.95.2 will have to be tested on all consortium development 
  architectures (Linux, Solaris, HP-UX), where this has not been done already.

- Evaluation of a SUN CC 4.0 or 5.0 build as a secondary compiler. No
  guaranteed Purify support during this interim period. Maintenance of 
  this build by a designated person in the project, as was done for 
  ecgs-1.0.3a. 

Proposed documentation changes:

Change to Note 237, and other documents where the project and secondary
compilers are listed.
