Statement of goals:

 To adopt MS format v2.0, for reasons outlined below. This was deliberately 
postponed until after beta 3.0, but it is now an appropriate time to 
proceed with adoption.

Proposed changes:
 
 Now documented in AIPS++ Note 229.

Expected impact:

 These changes been made in a trial area by Mark Wieringa and will be
made available on his home page, and summarized for others to review 
the impact on data fillers. Our assessment is that the changes will 
have modest impact.

Proposed documentation changes:

 Check in of this document to the AIPS++ Notes series.
