Statement of goals:

To establish some basic conventions for MeasurementSet columns
These conventions cover the names as they appear in any table within
a MeasurementSet, any associated comments, the names of non-predefined
columns and the relationship of these to the FITS standard. 

Proposed changes:

Note: PredefinedColumns is an enumeration currently describing all
columns in the MeasurementSet (a single table).  This is an
implementation detail that may change as multiple tables are used
within a single MeasurementSet (this change is covered in a 
separate proposal).  These rules should apply to all columns 
in all tables within a MeasurementSet.  The final implementation
may require some fine-tuning of these rules.

   - The standard column names (PredefinedColumns):
	o  The spelling of the individual PredefinedColumns enumeration
	   will be exactly the same as the Strings used to name those
	   columns in the MeasurementSet.
	o  The names may consist of all upper case, alphabetic characters,
	   all digits, plus the underscore and hyphen characters.  No
	   other special characters or lower case characters are
	   allowed.
	o  The names MUST be no longer than 68 characters (this allows
	   the column name to be used as is in a FITS binary table).
	o  It is strongly recommended that names be limited to 18
	   characters.
   - Comments:
	There is no limit to the length of an associated comment.
   - Column-associated keyword ( additional keywords are mentioned in other 
	proposals)
	LABEL - This is a String keyword which indicates a label
	   appropriate for this column (i.e. a more pleasing string
	   than simply using the column name, with all caps and no
 	   spaces, etc).  Additional "hints" keywords are likely but
	   are not proposed here.
  - Consortium member specific columns
	Each consortium member is given a prefix (ATNF_, BIMA_, 
	DRAO_, NFRA_, NRAO_, NRAL_, GMRT_).  Each member will be
	responsible for control over names beginning with their
	prefix.  Consortium members may add PredefinedColumns
	beginning with their prefix as they wish (after notifying
	the MeasurementSet czar of their intentions).
  - The non-standard columns
	All non-standard (not a PredefinedColumn) column names in
	a MeasurementSet must start with the prefix NS_


Expected Impact:

The positive impact be that it should be easy to convert between
a MS and a FITS binary table with no loss of information.  It
also imposes some naming conventions on the MeasurementSet and
provides a useful way for consortium members to manage their own
name-space.  Non-standard columns are clearly identified as
such and there is no danger that a future PredefinedColumn would
be confused with some sites already existing non-standard column.
