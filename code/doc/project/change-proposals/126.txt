Statement of goals:
----------------------------
Adopt doxygen as the standard AIPS++ code documentation engine.

Background:
------------------
Doxygen has become a widpread standard for documenting source code (for a
partial list of projects using doxygen see
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/projects.html).  Doxygen supports a
range of output formats (such as html, latex, man pages, rtf, xml, with ps
and pdf being indirectly supported through latex "make ps / pdf") and is
highly portable (Linux and Unix flavors, with executables for Windows, and
Mac OS X also available).  The tag format is based on JavaDoc (a standard or
Java code documentation) so the tags are comprehensive and easily understood.

Given that we maintain (and are about the only users of) cxx2html it would
be better to now switch to doxygen.

As a prototype, I have doxygenated some the implement directory of aips
(see http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~ddebonis/doxygen with a script I made using
Ger's
script as a translator.  There is also a doxygen comment example that I
created for the developer meeting on May 15th (look at Account_impl for a
complete example):

http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~ddebonis/meeting/20040514/doxygen/html/classAccount__impl.html

(Note: in this example I used the default javadoc style comment tags /*!
... */ and \ rather than @).

Most of the mappings between cxx2html tags and doxygen tags have been made
through Ger's perl script which I have attached to this proposal.

Here is a summary of the mappings (Note: I believe the @ sign to be easier
to discern than a \, so I decided to use it for the tag indicator):

cxx2html tag                        doxygen tag
------------                        -----------
//                                  //!

<linkto class={classname}>          @sa {classname}
<linkto group={groupname}>          @sa {groupname}
<linkto file={filename}>            @sa {filename}
<linkto module={modulename}>        @sa {modulename}

<srcblock>                          @code
</srcblock>                         @endcode
<src>                               @code ... @endcode

<summary>                           @brief
<module>                            @package

<group>                             @defgroup
<group name={groupname}>            @defgroup {groupname}

<note role=tip>                     @note
<note role=caution>                 @attention
<note role=warning>                 @warning

<etymology>                         @protocol
<prerequisite>                      @pre
<reviewed>                          @remark
<synopsis>                          n/a (no tag necessary)
<templating>                        @property
<thrown>                            @throw
<todo>                              @todo

<use visibility=export>             @interface
<use visibility=local>              @internal

Other tag extensions that will be useful that doxygen offers are:

@namespace     describes a namespace
@file          describes a file
@version       gives a version
@union         describes a union
@struct        describes a struct
@enum          describes an enum
@typedef       describes a typedef
@param         describes a method / function argument
@return        describes a return value
@author        name of author
@date          date of creation
@exception     describes an exception object
@overload      uses a common description reference
@copydoc       copy a block of documentation from another location
@anchor        place anchor for use with ref
@section       place section for use with ref
@subsection    place sub-section for use with ref
@page          place documentation page for use with ref
@ref           reference to placed anchor / section / page
@link          create a link to an object (file, class, or member)
@mainpage      customize the index page

A complete documentation of the expected use will be presented at the
completion of the migration.

Summary:
---------------
Switching to doxygen will remove an AIPS++ created tool (cxx2html) that we
maintain and replace it with a more standard code documentation tool.

Expected Impact:
--------------------------
Adoption of doxygen will require the translation of cxx2html tags to
doxygen tags.  Ger has written a script to do most of this already (a few
additional tags need to be added to the translator) and I have already
created an upper level script to drive the translator.

Changes will need to be put in place in the build system to replace
cxx2html with doxygen, pointers to obtaining doxygen (and optionally
graphviz) will need to be put in the documentation as well as how we
expect to use doxygen.
Also, a doxygen configuration file (which is attached to the end of this
proposal) will be added that defines how doxygen parses and presents the
documentation.  Note: the configuration file will be our distributed
version but clients could change its parameters to better suite their
needs (for instance, "dot" will be enabled but a client without Graphviz
nstalled could disable it to avoid the generation of the more extensive
graphical structure).  Both the header and source files will be parsed by
doxygen so that a complete representation of the code base will be
included in the documentation.

Since this change will touch nearly every file, I believe that a code
freeze (of less than half a day) should occur once the scripts have been
refined and thoroughly tested.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(due to size limitations, I was unable to submit the attached script and
configuration file... instead I will post them at
http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~ddebonis/proposal)
