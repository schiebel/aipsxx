Many of these lists are essentially inactive.

We maintain our own archiving scheme for messages (not using the mailman
archival feature).

 Summary:
 --------

 1. Move to using "Mailman's" archiving.  Keep the old messages but orphan the
pages so access to the list is not a link from any of the web pages in the AIPS++
web tree.

 2. Have only the following active lists.


 aips2                  General announcements; should be broadest
                        group. I believe this should ultimately be the
                        user mail list, though the listmgr reports
                        should not go here.
 aips2-inhale           Logs of builds. This includes inhales, assays
                        and benchmarks. Few should be subscribed to
                        this but the results can be viewed through an
                        archive. We'll also want something to  
                        summarize these results and mail to a broader
                        list.
 aips2-sneeze           Sneeze logs
 aips2-glish            Discussions related to Glish; particularly
                        important for planned migration away from
                        Glish.
 aips2-developers       This will combine the use of:
                        aips2-lib
                        aips2-workers
                        aips2-visualization
                        and Wim's suggested methods/tools/soft
                        engineering. We don't want to overwhelm people
                        with e-mail but these issues should be
                        generally universal and should concern
                        everyone. I also believe that the ME/MS
                        discussions belong here.
 aips2-sitemgr          Announcements/dicussions for managers of
                        installations.
                        Also OS related issues and software
                        engineering.
                        This will combine the use of:
                        aips2-sitemgr
                        aips2-system

 aips2-reports          As Wes mentioned, there is no digest mode so
 aips2-weekly-reports   reports from developers go to aips2-reports
                        and are combined and sent out as
                        aips2-weekly-reports. Not ideal but adequate.

 NRAO-only maintained lists: These concern local issues. Other sites
 can setup similar lists as needed.

 aips2-naug             NRAO user group - needed now for current
                        activities but will merge into aips2 at some
                        point.
 aips2-aoc              AOC site
 aips2-test             This is a diagnostic list for internal testing
                        purposes

These and the other local site lists will be converted to locally
 maintained lists off of the aips2 lists.

 3. Rather than email the entire sneeze log to aips2-inhale, have
 sneeze only email up to 50 errors lines to aips2-inhale.


---+++ Expected Impact 
Reduces the overhead of mailling list management. The mailman
archiving has options that encode the email addresses so we might get
on fewer spam lists.

Reduce the size of the mailed sneeze logs.

---+++ Documentation Changes
The AIPS++ E-mail reflectors page must be changed to reflect this.
