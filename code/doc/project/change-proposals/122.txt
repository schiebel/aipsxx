Statement of goals:

Remove aipsview from the AIPS++ code tree.

Proposed changes:

The aipsview application, provided through NCSA, is no longer maintained within
our code tree, post-consortium. NCSA has agreed that the best course is to 
remove this application from AIPS++. It can be installed as a stand-alone
application for those who want an up-to-date version.

Expected Impact:

This will eliminate the need for NRAO to maintain and update this code. The
application can still be obtained directly from NCSA.

Proposed documentation changes:

Remove documentation in URM, cookbooks. Provide a pointer to NCSA site for those
who use the application.
