<U><B>AIPS++ Quarterly Report: 1996 Q1<BR>
<BR>
</B></U>Tim Cornwell, AIPS++ Project Manager
<BR>
<BR>
April 15, 1996
<H3>Introduction
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
This report summarizes the status of the AIPS++ Project
at the end of the first quarter of 1996. It describes the achievements
during that quarter and gives a list of planned developments for
the second quarter of 1996. It also describes long-term plans
for the Project. Reports from each active AIPS++ site are included
in appendix A.
<H3>Developments in 1996
Q1<BR>
</H3>

<P>
In <B>Single Dish</B>, a development plan was formulated
and fixed for the time being. This plan includes work needed for
both the GBT development and the Parkes HI survey. Work has continued
in a number of areas:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Changes to the AIPS++ data store: the MeasurementSet
(see below in Synthesis for more details).
<LI>A plan for the development of the GUI for single
dish processing,
<LI>Development of specific Glish clients needed
for processing, 
</UL>

<P>
David Barnes of the ATNF Parkes HI survey team spent
8 weeks working with the SD group in Charlottesville.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Measures</B>, Wim Brouw froze the design and
worked on implementation. Completion of all major features except
high precision VLBI support is expected in May. Parts of the code
are now being reviewed.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Synthesis</B> processing, a demonstration is
available at:<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/uvdemo/101/101.html">http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/uvdemo/101/101.html</A>
<BR>

<P>
This shows the use of the <I>imager</I> program to
self-calibrate VLA data solving for both normal antenna-based
gains, and polarization leakage effects (the &quot;D-terms&quot;).
A substantial amount of effort was expended on optimization of
this program, with results that should benefit general applications
development in AIPS++. Revised specifications for various telescopes
were incorporated into a development plan. The design for the
MeasurementEquation was refined, splitting the ME into two parts,
a SkyEquation and a VisEquation, thus easing the eventual application
of this formalism to single dish processing. In coordination with
the single dish group, the MeasurementSet was redesigned, moving
away from one big AIPS++ table for all data to a more conventional
main table / sub tables scheme. This redesign was easily implemented
and is now in use in synthesis processing. Calibration information
was made persistent by writing to AIPS++ tables, in which form,
it can be viewed by tools in Glish/Glishtk such as the tablebrowser
and the plotting utilities. All these are steps on the way to
a full calibration package. This work has been performed in collaboration
with Mark Wieringa, who is spending six months working at the
Center with the synthesis group (this visit is funded by ATNF
and NFRA).<BR>

<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, the NCSA
group made various improvements to the aipsview visualization
tool with the goal of a beta release by April 15. The major area
of improvement is the inclusion of contour plotting via the PGPLOT
library.<BR>

<P>
In <B>AIPS++</B> <B>Infrastructure</B>, a large number
of improvements were made in response to the requirements arising
from applications development:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>The capabilities of Glishtk were expanded to
include nearly all of the tk widgets,
<LI>A improved and redesigned tablebrowser was implemented
in Glishtk,
<LI>AIPS++ table system underwent a number of improvements,
the most important being a Tiled Storage Manager to allow efficient
access to multidimensional data sets along various axes.
<LI>A number of miscellaneous utilities such as least
squares and interpolation classes were developed.
<LI>The implementation of the Tasking system was
completed and coding of applications based upon it is now proceeding.

</UL>

<P>
In <B>Documentation,</B> we decided on an overall
approach to programmer documentation, and began to implement it.
An initial version of a revised programmers manual is now in place
and being improved. <BR>

<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we worked on the implementation
of shared libraries under the Sun native compiler, and changed
to rely upon native exception handling. In addition, we have made
ports to various compilers:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>HP/UX, required for NFRA, is basically successful
and is now being completed,
<LI>After a considerable effort of trying a port
to the Dec Alpha compiler, required for ATNF, we decided to abandon
it since it went into a release cycle with bugs that were too
serious for us to work around.
<LI>In order to have a working port for the ATNF
Dec Alpha, we persisted with a port to the GNU Project g++ compiler.
This is proceeding well and we expect to have a working system
soon. This will give us the ability to port to many architectures
easily.
<LI>SGI, desired by NCSA, is proceeding.

</UL>

<P>
In <B>Management, </B>we continued the implementation
of a more formal scheme for proposing and accepting changes to
AIPS++.<BR>

<H3>Long-term plans
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The long term plans for the AIPS++ project were first
presented in the previous Quarterly report. Here we present an
updated list of AIPS++ goals in the next table:<BR>

</TABLE>

<P>
As before, the reliability gives an assessment of the probability
of meeting that goal. This is based upon a number of factors:
how well specified the goal is, the difficulty of the goal, and
the intrinsic priority of the goal to
AIPS++.<BR>

<P>
Only one major milestone has been passed since the last report:
the first synthesis application (denoted by the mark).
<H3>Plans for 1996 Q2<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The previous section gave long-term plans. Here we
summarize the expected developments over the next quarter. <BR>

<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we will continue with
the work required to support the friendly observer test at the
140' telescope in June 1996. This includes writing a number of
Glish clients for analysis, and putting together all the key elements
in the AIPS++ GUI. <BR>

<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we will continue the
development of the polarization deconvolution and selfcalibration
task, adding a simple user interface based upon the Tasking design,
and a GUI based upon Glishtk. We will continue development of
simulation software for testing and verification. We will write
a simple mosaicing task to test the applicability of the concepts
in the MeasurementEquation formalism. We will finish the WSRT
filler into the MeasurementSet and perform some trial reductions
of WSRT data. We will write new tools for gridding and fast Fourier
transformation of visibility data. We will begin an investigation
of the adaptation of the synthesis code to parallel processing.
<BR>

<P>
In <B>Measures</B>, we will complete the implementation,
save for the highest precision modes needed for VLBI and pulsar
observations. We will write a modified Image Coordinate System
incorporating the Measures system.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Glish support</B>, we will work towards improving
the stability and robustness of Glish and Glishtk. We will revise
the documentation of Glish to bring it up to date. We will develop
a test suite for Glish capabilities. We will issue a new release
of Glish.<BR>

<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we will develop
a Table data manager for sparse data, allow the use of Record
(the AIPS++ heterogeneous container) in Tables. We will make a
number of improvements to the tablebrowser, for both functionality
and efficiency.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, we will
issue a beta release of aipsview complete with contouring and
other improvements. We will study the possibility of incorporating
into aipsview support for AIPS++ Images and full non-linear coordinates.
We will issue a development plan for the ATNF/NCSA collaboration
on Visualization and Image Analysis. We will continue work targeted
towards a beta release of Inventor AIPSView in July 1996.<BR>

<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we will investigate possible
schemes for reducing the deleterious effects of the wide-spread
use of templates in AIPS++.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we will continue the revision
of the programmers manual.
<H3>Project-wide concerns
<BR>
</H3>

<H3><I>Inadequate staffing<BR>
</I></H3>

<P>
In the last report, it was noted that the Project
was inadequately staffed. In particular, the following positions
were deemed to be particularly important:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>an AIPS++ scientific programmer at GB,
<LI>a scientific programmer at NFRA to help with
the AIPS++ support of the TMS commissioning, 
<LI>scientific programmers at the AOC and at ATNF
to help with development of Synthesis processing.

</UL>

<P>
None of these have come about. The danger to the
Project is obvious: a possibility that we will miss some of the
major milestones.<BR>

<P>
<I>Transition to an operational system<BR>
</I>
<P>
According to the timetable presented above, AIPS++
will begin to be available for end-users in early 1997. It is
vital that we start planning for this now. The most pressing concerns
are to:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Ensure that interesting functionality is present
for some users,
<LI>Improve user and programmer documentation,
<LI>Improve end-user installation procedures
<LI>Ensure adequate testing prior to any release.

</OL>

<P>
Addressing some of these concerns will require additional
staff. 1 is implicitly addressed in the various development plans.
The functionality targeted in the beta release of AIPS++ will
be specified in June 1996. The user side of 2 is to be addressed
by Alan Bridle, who plans to resume work inside the Project in
May. The one person currently dedicated to programmer documentation
is soon to be removed from the AIPS++ group. The inadequacy of
the end-user installation procedures is well demonstrated (see
e.g. the ATNF and BIMA/NCSA site reports). Inside NRAO, we expect
to draw on the experience of the AIPS group in end-user installations.
4 could usefully be addressed by scientists from the various consortium
members. An example of this type of work is current testing of
the Glish system where Harvey Liszt and Darrell Schiebel are scheduled
to work together for a few months with the specific goal of finding
and fixing bugs. Similar efforts should be started with other
parts of the system later in the year.<BR>

<P>
<I>Standard hardware configuration for AIPS++<BR>
</I>
<P>
We have attempted to define a standard configuration
for a machine that is to run AIPS++. The basic formulation is
that AIPS++ should perform well for problems of a normal size
on a Unix-based workstation costing $5,000. An exemplar of such
a machine is a Sun Sparcstation 4, with 64 Mbyte of main memory,
and a few gigabytes of disk storage. Our main concern is that
the memory will be too small for interesting problems. We will
soon have to fix a policy for the use of memory inside AIPS++
programs. We plan to continue to track this issue closely over
the next 6-12 months.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I>Scheduling<BR>
</I>
<P>
To better quantify our ability to meet targets, we
have reviewed the success of the target dates scheme that we use
to track progress. In the 9 months since we instituted the target
dates in May 1995, we have completed 111 targets. Of these, 3
were in advance, and 48 were more than 10 (calendar) days late
(where the average duration of a target is about 20 days). The
48 late targets can be categorized in the following way:<BR>

<P>
19 Underestimated difficulty of target (e.g. complex
design issues)
<P>
19 Person obviously overloaded (usually due to unforeseen
problems or, more rarely, other targets in conflict)
<P>
4 Obviously bad choices for target dates (e.g. inappropriate
dates for some external event such as ADASS)
<P>
3 External factors (e.g. waiting for someone outside
the project to do something)
<P>
3 Person culpable<BR>

<P>
The division is highly subjective, and the analysis
is clearly limited. However, the basic conclusions are that we
need to pay more attention to the first two types of problem.
Fixing the first (underestimating the difficulty) will require
more intermediate targets as checks. The second (overloading of
time) is harder to deal with since it tends to be interrupt-driven,
as key people are called upon to help diagnose or fix urgent problems.
Perhaps the best approach here is to ensure that everyone is aware
of this latter effect.<BR>

<P>
<I>Reliance on the Internet<BR>
</I>
<P>
AIPS++ is suffering from the side-effects of the
vast increase in interest in and use of the Internet. We rely
upon the Internet for a number of purposes:
<UL>
<LI>General communication inside the Project is accomplished
by person-to-person email and by the use of e-mail exploders.
<LI>Code distribution and management. Revision control
is accomplished via direct access to the master repository of
code in Charlottesville using an NFS mount.
<LI>Project members often need to work on machines
at other sites e.g. for porting purposes.

</UL>

<P>
Both the latter uses are being adversely affected
by the general increased load on the Internet. One answer inside
NRAO may lie in the tentative proposal for an NRAO Intranet. This
will do little to address difficulties for external sites and
so we anticipate having to do some work make our code management
and distribution system more useable over a poorly responsive
network. Note that a decision on the possible move of the code
master to Socorro has been deferred until the question of an NRAO
Intranet has been settled.<BR>

<P>
<I>Scientific and Technical Advisory Group<BR>
</I>
<P>
The member of the advisory group is now mostly settled,
with a few remaining possible additions. See Appendix D for the
list of members. The group is expected to meet first in September
or October. The purpose of the group is to advise the Project
Manager on scientific and technical matters relevant to the Project.

<H3>Appendix A: Site reports
</H3>

<H4>ATNF
<BR>
</H4>

<P>
The ATNF currently has 5
people working in AIPS++. These are Neil Killeen (local manager),
Mark Calabretta, Wim Brouw, Mark Wieringa and Tom Oosterloo. Additionally,
there is a collaboration between the AIPS++ project and the ATNF
headed Parkes 21cm multi-beam receiver project, which includes
Taisheng Ye working primarily in AIPS++.<BR>

<P>
In Epping we have acquired a new Sun Ultra 140 server
specifically for AIPS++. It is configured with 192Mb of memory
(essential for AIPS++ C++ compilations to run at a reasonable
speed) and a fast-wide 9Gb disk.<BR>

<P>
Mark Calabretta's main responsibility is to the code
distribution system. His time in the last quarter has been spent
on:
<UL>
<LI>Implementing a simple system for putting template
instantiations in the class library.
<LI>Working on Glish within AIPS++.
<LI>uprev to v06.
<LI>Setting up new AIPS++ server for Epping.
<LI>Answering the usual requests for bug fixes or
new features and local programmer assistance.

</UL>

<P>
Mark has spent approximately 50% of his time on AIPS++
related work. His nominal AIPS++ allocation is 50%. At present,
this level will be sustained indefinitely.<BR>

<P>
Wim Brouw's responsibility is mainly to designing
and implementing the measure and related classes. His time has
been spent on:
<UL>
<LI>With the aid of the St Petersburg Astrophysics
Institute, and the Mt Stromlo library, Wim finished the basic
coordinate conversion routines. They (precession, nutation, annual
aberration and solar position for gravitational bending) are almost
finished for both J2000 and B1950.
<LI>Speeding up the unit and quantum speeds. Large
improvements were made, and checked in.
<LI>Being involved in some of the measurement set
related discussions. 
</UL>

<P>
However in trying to finalize the full measure class
and its conversions, Wim encountered an obscure cfront compiler
error. With help from NRAO, this was eventually bypassed. This
plus some other pressing work has delayed delivery for the full
system (due 22/mar/96).<BR>

<P>
Wim notes that his productivity was badly damaged
by spending about 40% of his AIPS++ time on system/compiler related
issues. He has spent 22% of his time on AIPS++ related issues
in this quarter.<BR>

<P>
Mark Wieringa is a part of the team working on the
synthesis related classes. He is currently in Socorro on his second
3-month stay there working with Tim Cornwell. He has spent his
AIPS++ time on
<UL>
<LI>Reworking the MeasurementSet. It is now a table
with a collection of sub-tables for antenna, feed, frequency etc
information. 
<LI>Updating the single source fits filler, the visibility
iterator and the VisSet to use the new MeasurementSet.
<LI>Working on simulation software so that the MEGI
formulation can be well explored. 
</UL>

<P>
Mark has spent 75% of his time on AIPS++ in this
quarter. His nominal AIPS++ allocation is 50%. <BR>

<P>
Mark's involvement in AIPS++ is negotiated yearly
with Narrabri since he has been seconded to the project from the
Narrabri computer group. Currently the agreement is until mid-1996.
<BR>

<P>
Tom Oosterloo is working on visualization and image
analysis software. This work involves collaboration with the NCSA
AIPS++ group. His time in the last quarter has been spent on 
<UL>
<LI>Reviewing Aipsview v1.0
<LI>Brief review of Aipsview v1.1
<LI>Outlining the case for Aipsview to be restructured
as a widget set (image display library) 
<LI>Writing the user specifications for volume rendering

<LI>Planning the general layout of the 21cm multi-beam
display software 
<LI>Working on the user specifications for the multi-beam
visualisation software multi-beam
<LI>Reading (object oriented methods (book rumbaugh),
AIPS++ docs, c++, etc) 
</UL>

<P>
Tom's nominal AIPS++ allocation is 75%. He has spent
about this amount on AIPS++ in the last quarter.<BR>

<P>
Neil Killeen spends most of his AIPS++ time attending
to local ATNF AIPS++ management issues but is also beginning to
plan some simple image analysis software. Neil writes that he
has spent his AIPS++ time on
<UL>
<LI>Procurement of the Ultra 140 server 
<LI>Liaison with multi-beam group
<LI>Discussing with NCSA and Tim Cornwell, the future
of the visualization and image analysis collaboration.
<LI>Working on a development plan for image analysis
and visualization.
<LI>Annual ATNF Steering Committee report on AIPS++
<LI>Annual report to Australian Government Department
of Industry, Science and Technology for obtaining AIPS++ travel
related funding.
<LI>Discussion with Tom Oosterloo about the visualization
software
<LI>Measurement set discussions.
<LI>Began to learn the Glish language with which
I will write some simple image analysis applications. I also started
to work out what infrastructure is available to me from Glish.
In this regard, I found the documentation of AIPS++ rather poor.
Glish has an excellent manual, but in order to answer very basic
questions I was forced to ask people, mainly Brian Glendenning.
I also find in general that the documentation pages are poor.
It is easy to find out what is something that is a future target,
but it is hard to find out what is done and how is it accessed.
My questions were:
<UL>
<LI>How do I read a FITS image into AIPS++ ?
<LI>How do I access an AIPS++ table from Glish ?
<LI>How do I access the 1-D plotting tool plot1d
from Glish ?
<LI>How do I display an image with Aipsview via Glish
? 
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
I have no nominal AIPS++ time allocation, and the
load varies. I would guess that averaged over the last quarter,
I have spent some 30% of my time on AIPS++.<BR>

<P>
The multi-beam received project is using AIPS++ as
its software base. Their main experience comes from David Barnes
who spent a few months in Charlottesville starting in early 1996.
They report:
<UL>
<LI>AIPS++ is very hard to install. This is because
of the complexity of the procedures, as well as the fragility
of the tools (C++ compilers).
<LI>We are very happy with support received at Charlottesville
-this aspect of the collaboration worked well. It also enabled
the previewing of unreleased software such as Glishtk and we hope
that this can continue.
<LI>David Barnes was able to put together a skeleton
reduction system relatively quickly (filler-calibrator-browser).
Taisheng Ye in Epping has already modified the filler to read
multi-beam data and to write out a SD MS.
<LI>We are not happy with delays in definitions with
the SD MS and the SD FITS formats. This may cause us to diverge
from the AIPS++ definitions if this is not resolved soon. From
the astronomers point of view, these should be the first things
to be defined, not the last. Our writing of code is being delayed
by this uncertainty. 
</UL>

<H4>BIMA/NCSA <BR>
</H4>

<P>
The BIMA/NCSA effort the
past quarter continued to concentrate on visualization development.
New features and bug fixes for aipsview, continued development
of Inventor aipsview, AIPS++ graphics, and installation of a full
AIPS++ system at NCSA were the major efforts. Individual efforts
are listed below:<BR>

<P>
Dick Crutcher (25% time): Time was spent on AIPS++
management, testing aipsview, and writing aipsview user documentation.
<BR>

<P>
Polly Baker and George Baxter (50% time each): In
the area of 3D visualization, they continued work toward a July
beta release of the Inventor aipsview program. They did considerable
cleanup to the code supporting Inventor aipsview, started a review
of the in-code documentation, built a tool for reading the VRML
files produced by Inventor aipsview into NCSA's virtual environments:
the CAVE and ImmersaDesk. In part, this served as a warm-up exercise
to building a tool that can support Inventor aipsview's data visualization
functions in these environments.<BR>

<P>
Harold Ravlin (80% time): He is the main person responsible
for aipsview maintenance and improvements. The major effort has
been to add the pgplot vector graphics package to aipsview. Major
new features which have been added to aipsview this quarter are
the ability to plot contours, to show a box around an image display
area with axis ticks and coordinate annotation, to show a colormap
wedge when an image is shown as a raster and the axes are displayed,
and to produce a postscript file (for printing) of raster images
and/or contour representations of images, with or without axis
notations. Contour values may be set as the user chooses, contours
may be displayed alone, on top of the associated raster image,
or on top of another raster image. Contours update just like rasters
when animations are run. Axes annotations are controlled by defaults.
Various minor features and bug fixes were also added to aipsview.
<BR>

<P>
John Pixton (100% time): He has worked mainly on
producing a plot1d widget using pgplot that will replace the commercial
widget now used in AIPS++ for general vector graphics work. This
is expected to be finished by the middle of April. In addition,
he worked on a design for an interface between aipsview and external
programs, that might be used to interface existing fortran or
C analysis codes with aipsview. He also worked to fix some aipsview
bugs, and assisted Randy Sharpe in the installation of a full
AIPS++ Solaris system at NCSA.<BR>

<P>
Randy Sharpe (20% time): He installed a full AIPS++
installation at NCSA on a Solaris system and began work on a port
of AIPS++ to our SGI Power Challenge Array. This work will be
taken over by Doug Roberts, who will become a 50% AIPS++ worker
during the second quarter, with a focus on parallel processor
applications.<BR>

<P>
Peter Teuben (10% time): He worked on the specification
of BIMA requirements for calibration of BIMA data. This should
be finished by the end of the quarter.

<P>
It has not been possible to hire an AIPS++ application programmer
at NFRA in time to play a significant role in the commissioning
of the first production version of the new WSRT Telescope Management
System (TMS) in august 1996. In view of the financial situation
of NFRA, it is also increasingly doubtful that such a person can
be hired in 1997, despite general agreement that it is highly
desirable.<BR>

<P>
Jan Noordam has checked in version 2.0 of AIPS++ Note 185.

<P>
Friso Olnon has delivered a working prototype of the WSRT data
filler. The work has been delayed somewhat by the revision of
the MeasurementSet.
<H5><I>AIPS++ Site in Dwingeloo</I> <BR>
</H5>

<P>
End of February the regular maintenance of NFRA's AIPS++ site
was transfered from the local AIPS++ project group to the general
R&amp;D maintenance group (FAM), consisting of Henk Vosmeijer
and Friso Olnon. As part of this transfer activity, Olnon wrote
the &quot;NFRA/AIPS++ Configuration Manual&quot; conform the NFRA
standard, which is essentially an introduction to the AIPS++ System
Manual by Mark Calabretta.<BR>

<P>
At the same time the NFRA installation was extended to include
an HP Unix host, which is required for the new WSRT on-line system
TMS. The environment for AIPS++ work now exists, but not all standard
AIPS++ code compiles and links on the HP. As long as the Center
does not have an HP itself, the NFRA group will continue to assist
the Center in supporting the HP platform in the future.<BR>

<P>
The AIPS++ installation on the Sun/Solaris host keeps working
without much trouble. That is the platform on which all current
local AIPS++ development is done. At the time of writing (March
5) we have problems building Glish clients, but the FAM group
is working on that with the help of Darrell Schiebel. <BR>

<P>
Ger van Diepen has conducted two C++ workshops at NFRA. This included
advanced subjects like &quot;counted reference&quot;, &quot;copy-on-write&quot;
and &quot;expression tree&quot;.
<H5><I>Infrastructure software</I>. <BR>
</H5>

<P>
Ger van Diepen has put considerable work into documenting the
new Table software. He also implemented some small changes in
the Table system at the request of some users. <BR>

<P>
He has developed a framework for data format conversion (e.g.
VAX&lt;-&gt;IEEE). This will be used in the MeasurementSet filler,
and perhaps by TMS. The student Anco Boersma has developed an
IO framework, which will allow transparent IO in which the conversion
classes can be easily integrated.<BR>

<P>
The development of the new Record classes is almost finished.
With these classes, arbitrary recursive structures can be specified,
instantiated and made persistent. The Table system supports these
structures.

<H3>Appendix C: Review of
developments promised for 1995 Q4<BR>
</H3>

<P>
This section has been written to mirror the section
in the last quarterly report on plans for 1995 Q4.<BR>

<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we did implement an
improved tablebrowser, based upon the Glishtk GUI machinery. We
did not yet write a first GUI with simple astronomical task, but
we did complete approximately 50% of the Glish C++ clients needed
for the observations. David Barnes did visit Charlottesville to
work with the group for 8 weeks on support of the Parkes Multi-beam
observations.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we did finish a task
to do polarization leakage self-calibration and imaging, we did
improve gridding and the use of FFTs, we did ensure persistence
for calibration objects, we did develop capabilities for simulation
of synthesis observations, but we did not write a first GUI-based
imaging task. In preparation for the commissioning of the WSRT
TMS, we did write a prototype filler to load WSRT data into a
Synthesis MeasurementSet. We did not yet start a collaboration
between the Synthesis group and NCSA to investigate and possibly
implement selected synthesis algorithms on parallel processing
machines.<BR>

<P>
In <B>Measures</B>, we did complete a re-design of
the classes. A completed Measures implementation will not be available
by the end of the quarter but we expect it to be finished mid-April.
<BR>

<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we did continue
work on the Table system, finishing the Tiled storage manager.
We deferred improving the existing Run-Length-Encoded storage
manager (called the &quot;Miriad&quot; storage manager). We did
complete a re-write of the File and I/O classes. We did implement
a system allowing time-changing data such as IERS data to be available
inside AIPS++ via the Tables system. The VLA calibrator list is
one of the first sources of data included. The implementation
of the tasking system (<A HREF="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/notes/185.ps">http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/notes/185.ps</A>)
did continue, first with the control hub and C++ run-time system,
and then with a sample application to the Table system. <BR>

<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, we have
make progress but did not yet finish re-implementing the gplot1d
Glish client on top of the PGPLOT graphics widget. We did investigate
and proceed with putting PGPLOT graphics capabilities directly
into Aipsview, and we did add hardcopy output to Aipsview.<BR>

<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we did partially implement
shared libraries. We did not add automatic registration for the
AIPS++ e-mail exploders (a &quot;majordomo&quot;), nor transfer
the AIPS++ master code repository to Socorro. We did attempt ports
to the g++ compiler, and to Dec Alphas, SGI and HP/UX configurations.
We did implement the now-standard compiler exception mechanism.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we did revise the programmer's
section of the on-line documentation, identify and remove out-of-date
documents. We started on but did not complete a revision of the
format of source code documentation. We did put programming entries
in the AIPS++ Glossary. We did fully implement and start to use
the gnats bug reporting system.<BR>

<P>
In<B> Management</B>, we did form and schedule a
meeting of a Scientific Advisory Group for AIPS++. Tim Cornwell
did not visit Pune for discussions with GMRT staff.<BR>

<P>
In addition, Allen Farris of STScI did re-design
and re-implement the FITS classes used by AIPS++. We will benefit
directly from this work.
