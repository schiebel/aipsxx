<U><B>AIPS++ Quarterly Report: 1995 Q3</B></U> 
<P>
Tim Cornwell, AIPS++ Project Manager
<P>
October 5, 1995
<P>
This report summarizes the status of the AIPS++ Project at the
end of the third quarter of 1995. It describes the achievements
during that quarter and reviews the developments promised in the
previous quarterly report. The report then gives a list of planned
developments for the fourth quarter of 1995. Reports from each
active AIPS++ site are included in an appendix.
<P>
Progress was made in many areas of the project. The most important
achievement was the participation in the tests of the GBT Monitor
and Control system on the NRAO 140' telescope. This was the first
mission-critical use of AIPS++ and demonstrated the usability
and reliability of several AIPS++ components: the Glish system,
the Table system, and various fitting and plotting capabilities.
In other areas, development proceeded as required to support this
work and application development in other areas. We continue with
our strategy of developing a few key applications with the goals
of testing the AIPS++ infrastructure and attracting early adopters
to AIPS++.
<P>
The consortium interactions are working well. The Project Manager
visited ATNF in August (see the ATNF Site report in Appendix A)
and took part in a number of useful discussions. This has led
to a collaboration between ATNF and NCSA/BIMA on Image Analysis
and Visualization.
<H3> Developments in 1995 Q3</H3>

<P>
In this section, I describe the work that actually was done in
the last quarter. The overarching rationale behind all of the
work performed in AIPS++ remains the push to applications development,
both in Single Dish and Synthesis.
<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we continued our participation
in the tests of the GBT Monitor and Control system on the 140'
telescope. In these tests, designed to test both the M&amp;C system
and various parts of the electronics, AIPS++ was to provide the
analysis capabilities. The goals were to load monitor and astronomical
data from a number of FITS binary tables into the AIPS++ Table
system and to provide analysis and plotting capabilities. The
timeline was this development was agreed in collaboration with
the GBT M&amp;C group in a series of meeting starting in late
March 1995. The first tests took place in July 1995. This was
the first &quot;mission-critical&quot; use of AIPS++, and so our
ability to fulfill expectations was on trial. AIPS++ met all the
specified goals in functionality. In addition, the combination
of the Glish system and the plotting and analysis tools was found
to provide an accommodating environment for debugging. To track
down unexpected behavior in some of the data, the group running
the tests (not from the AIPS++ group) were able to try different
and unanticipated ways of plotting the data. A <A HREF="../sddemo/101/gbt.html">demonstration</A>
of this type of use of AIPS++ is available on the WWW. These tests
are continuing throughout the fall. AIPS++ will continue to provide
support but it is anticipated that much of the burden of writing
Glish scripts for the analysis will be able to be assumed by the
GBT data analysis group.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we decided to adopt the Hamaker,
Bregman, Sault formalism for as the basis for AIPS++ polarization
calibration and imaging. A number of memos have been written,
principally by Noordam and Cornwell, on this approach (see the
AIPS++ Implementation Notes). Cornwell and Wieringa are now embarking
upon design of classes.
<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, Glish has seen substantial enhancements
and improvements. These and the plans for the future are documented
in the <A HREF="http://info.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/html/glishdev.html">Glish Development Plan</A>.
By agreement with the author of the package, Vern Paxson, we have
assumed responsibility for distributing Glish. This is good for
AIPS++ since Glish lies at the heart of our development strategy
in both command line interface development and task control. The
design of the support for task control within AIPS++ has been
slower than expected, mainly due to oversubscription of the time
of Brian Glendenning but it is now complete and we are starting
on implementation. We made a number of substantial improvements
to the Lattice and Image classes that will be vital for applications
development. We completed a design for a generic filler program
to load telescope data into AIPS++, and are now proceeding to
implement the design. We designed and started to implement a tiled
storage manager for the AIPS++ Table system. We started design
and implementation of the Coordinate classes (by Wim Brouw at
ATNF).
<P>
In <B>Visualization</B>, AIPSView went through a number of alpha
test phases and was released in version beta 1. The specific improvements
to AIPSView are described in the BIMA site report. In addition
to the 2D display present in AIPSView, we have developed a prototype
for 3D visual analysis based on the OpenGL and OpenInventor libraries.
Inventor AIPSview allows full 24-bit color, simultaneous display
of multiple data cubes mixing or matching among simultaneous display
modes integrated into a single view. Display modes include 3D
slicing parallel to the three faces of data cubes, isosurface
rendering, contouring, volumentric rendering, and others.
<P>
In <B>System</B>, we participated in beta testing of the new Sun
native code C++ compiler. As a result of the feedback that we
gave, we are now able to adopt the compiler to some considerable
advantage in speed of compilation and ease of use. We installed
AIPS++ on an SGI PowerChallenge computer. We added an e-mail exploder
archive. We can now do rebuilds of AIPS++ in parallel on a number
of CPUs.
<P>
In<B> Personnel</B>, the Project center completed hiring of two
new members in Socorro. These will bring skills in a number of
areas: radio and optical Synthesis, signal processing, parallel
processing in C++, grand challenge computing, and numerical astrophysics.
There have been a small number of short-term visits between sites.
Mark Wieringa is visiting the AOC for 6 months to work on Synthesis
processing.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we started a Documentation group headed
by Alan Bridle. Most of the work in the quarter was in the area
of User Documentation.
<P>
In<B> Management</B>, we negotiated a collaboration between NCSA/BIMA
and ATNF on Image Analysis and Visualization (see below). We took
part in discussions on the possible future use of AIPS++ in a
number of areas: pulsars and multibeam observations at ATNF, and
VLBI correlator support at NRAO and the JIVE. None of these discussions
have yet led to any concrete action. We commissioned new requirements
documents for NFRA and ATNF, describing the most urgent needs
for AIPS++ development.
<H3>Review of developments promised for 1995 Q3</H3>

<P>
This section has been written to mirror the section in the last
quarterly report on plans for 1995 Q3. The purpose is to delineate
goals and actual achievements and to establish whether the Project
has any systemic problems in keeping to agreed targets.
<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we chose to make our highest priority
support of the GBT systems integration work on the NRAO 140' telescope.
Because of this and a lack of support at the telescope, we dropped
development of the On-The-Fly mapping tool developed for and installed
at the NRAO 12m telescope. We worked on specification of SDCalc
(for analysis of Single Dish spectra) and SDImager (for imaging
from Single Dish data) but did not reach a final specification.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we changed strategy as described
above. We had planned to develop tools for advanced imaging using
the Briggs NNLS deconvolution algorithm in a selfcalibration cycle.
Instead, we adopted the Hamaker-Bregman-Sault formalism. The reason
for this change in strategy is that it allows unified development
of calibration and imaging for all consortium interferometers
(and probably single dishes). As a result, the telescope-specific
lines of development that previously showed up in the development
plan are expected to be substantially less time-consuming. Little
actual time was lost in this change in strategy. It is expected
that the Briggs NNLS algorithm will be implemented once the basic
framework is in place.
<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we did develop the Glish system
(the User Interface and Control Hub) according to the <A HREF="http://info.cv.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/html/glishdev.html">Glish Development Plan</A>.
We did not yet complete design of the Coordinate classes but it
is proceeding satisfactorily. This is expected to be done by the
middle of the next quarter. We are continuing to add support for
tiled hypercube access to the AIPS++ Table System.
<P>
In <B>Visualization</B>, we did continue to add functionality
to AIPSView but not as directly in response to need as hoped.
In addition, extension of AIPSView to include 3D visualization
did continue but will change with the advent of a collaboration
between NCSA and ATNF to work on Image Analysis and Visualization
We did select a package for line graphics inside AIPS++ (the Fermilab
widgets) to replace the commercial widget (Xrt/Graph) currently
used in the GBT work.
<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we did not add support for automated
testing of AIPS++ classes. We did investigate use of the new Sun
native code C++ compiler and are adopting it. We deferred re-assessment
of any possible use of the IBM compiler.
<P>
In<B> Personnel</B>, we completed hiring of two positions in Socorro,
one of which will be supported initially by funding from NFRA.
The arrival dates are 1 November and 1 January. Wieringa is visiting
Socorro for a 6 month period starting in September (Funding for
this comes from ATNF and NFRA).
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we did continue the development of the
overall documentation system, paying some more attention to the
programmer level documentation.
<P>
In<B> Management</B>, the Project Manager worked on communication
by visiting ATNF and paying particular attention to a new requirements
document. We did not formalize work structuring by adopting approaches
similar to those proposed by the <A HREF="http://www.nfra.nl:80/~olnon/seg">NFRA Software Engineering Group</A>.
This has been deferred pending more experience with the results
from that group.
<P>
In reviewing the work promised and that achieved, we were alert
to serious systemic problems in meeting targets. The target dates
system for tracking work has been quite satisfactory. The biggest
problem in keeping to target dates has been the unexpected. Key
personnel who know many things about the system are particularly
liable to this since they are best able to solve these unexpected
problems. The AIPS++ code maintenance system is generally very
robust but it is an example of an area where the unexpected can
occur. Mark Calabretta has provided very good response to all
problems in this area, but it does take a large fraction of his
time that is allocated to AIPS++ with the result that some planned
system-related enhancements have had to be deferred. Brian Glendenning
is another key person whose advice is sought after by others in
the Project. However, leaving aside interruptions, most of the
AIPS++ group are quite accurate in estimating the time required
to complete a project, if the task is well-defined. If the task
is not well-defined then estimation is of course difficult.
<P>
In summary, I think it is clear that the project has overall had
a good success rate at setting and meeting targets and that there
are no serious systemic problems that need rectifying. The one
caveat is that perhaps we could be more conservative in allowing
for interruptions in the work of key personnel.
<H3>Plans for 1995 Q4</H3>

<P>
The development plans for the next 12-18 months are given in the
<A HREF="http://aips2.nrao.edu/aips++/docs/project/devplan.html">AIPS++ Development Plan </A>.
Here I summarize the expected developments over the next quarter.
Again, the rationale behind the priorities is the push to applications
development.
<P>
In<B> Single Dish support</B>, we will continue support of the
GBT tests. We will consolidate some of the work performed so far,
principally by working to further improve some of the Glish scripts.
We will start on a path of evolving the existing capabilities
into a longer term, more substantial single dish capability. A
development plan for Single Dish is targeted for mid November.
<P>
In <B>Synthesis support</B>, we will continue development of the
measurement equation for a general interferometer. We expect to
be able to make images, deconvolve and perhaps self-calibrate
polarization measurements. It is probable that the initial goals
will be a Clean algorithm for simultaneous deconvolution of Stokes
I,Q,U and V, and self-calibration of the antenna-based polarization
leakage terms.
<P>
In <B>AIPS++ Infrastructure</B>, we will finish work on the tiled
storage manager for the Table system (needed for efficient access
of multidimensional data). We will finish design and start implementation
of classes for Task control and interaction. We will continue
with the development of Coordinate classes now proceeding under
the supervision of Wim Brouw. We will write improved linear algebra
classes (needed for the Coordinate classes, and other areas).
<P>
In <B>Visualization and Image Analysis</B>, ATNF and NCSA will
collaborate. ATNF will be primarily responsible for Image Analysis
and volume rendering in AIPSView, and NCSA will be primarily responsible
for Visualization, 1D graphics, and the GUI for visualization.
We will use a commercially available library, OpenGL/Inventor,
for high-level 3D visualization work. Volume rendering algorithms
developed using Richard Gooch's Karma library will be implemented
in AIPSView. We will investigate the feasibility of incorporating
vector graphics (the Fermilab widgets) into AIPSView. A small
pilot project in Visualization and Image Analysis will be started,
with the target being interactive fitting of either a galaxy model
or Gaussian profiles to a spectral cube.
<P>
In the <B>System</B> area, we will implement shared libraries
(thus reducing executable size), start using by default the new
Sun native code compiler (speeding compilations substantially),
implement a bug reporting system, and implement release versions.
We will move the AIPS++ master code respository to Socorro.
<P>
In <B>Documentation</B>, we will continue the push for user and
programmer documentation. We will start development of some of
the software tools needed to extract documentation from code and
to interface to the design of tasking inside AIPS++.
<P>
In<B> Management</B>, we will continue to monitor the success
of the NFRA Software Engineering Group with a view to possible
adoption of some of their methods.
<P>
In addition, we will give a number of <B>presentations</B> at
the annual Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems meeting
in Tucson.
<H3>Requests for action or approval</H3>

<OL>
<LI>The key consortium wide decision that must be approved is
the use of a commercial library/toolkit OpenGL/OpenInventor to
support 3D visualization work (&quot;Inventor AIPSView&quot;).
This is described in the BIMA site report. We believe that use
of this toolkit cuts development time by a factor of two. It does,
however, limit development work to sites having a license (cost
approximately a few hundred US dollars). At the moment, this work
is limited to the BIMA/NCSA and ATNF sites, both of which are
willing to purchase licenses. The reason for going with a commercially-available
toolkit is that at this stage of the project, cutting development
time is much more important than ensuring wide-spread accessibility
of this rather specialized code.
</OL>

<P>
 <I>Approved by Board.</I>
<H3>Appendix A: Site reports</H3>

<H4>ATNF</H4>

<H6>Personnel Activity:</H6>

<P>
The ATNF currently has 3 active workers, as well as Neil Killeen<I>,
</I>the local manager. These are Mark Calabretta, Wim Brouw,<I>
</I>and Mark Wieringa. Bob Sault acts in a consultant mode.
<P>
Mark Calabretta's main responsibility is to the code<I> </I>distribution
system. His time in the last quarter has been spent on <I>:</I>

<UL>
<LI>Doing the initial SGI installation on the new ATNF/RP SGI
PowerChallenge computer. Some compiler bugs were fixed which were
dealt with by SGI in timely fashion
<LI>Making the SUN native compiler installation
<LI>AIPS++ E-mail exploder archive
<LI>v05 uprev
<LI>Implementing Parallel rebuilds
<LI>Enhancements to the makedefs
<LI>Assisting with Socorro &amp; Pune installations
</UL>

<P>
In addition, as a project separate from AIPS++, Mark worked on
writing a Fortran library for WCSLIB (World Coordinate System)
which be used by AIPS++. Including this, Mark has spent approximately
60% of his time on AIPS++ related work. His nominal AIPS++ allocation
is 50% at present. This level will be sustained indefinitely.
<P>
Wim Brouw's responsibility is mainly to designing and implementing
the Measure and related Classes. His time has been spent on:
<UL>
<LI>The design of the Measure class, dealing with measured, astronomical,
coordinates and their conversions from one reference frame to
another.
<LI>Code copping of the Fitting classes
<LI>Participated in discussions on some AIPS++ library issues
and astronomical design.
</UL>

<P>
Wim has spent 10% (July), 30% (August) and 60% (September) on
AIPS++. His nominal contribution is 50%. At present, this level
will be sustained for at least the next year.
<P>
Mark Wieringa is a part of the team working on the Synthesis related
classes. He has just gone (beginning September) to Socorro for
6 months. Following his return from 3 months in Dwingeloo earlier
this year, Mark's AIPS++ activity has been low because the Synthesis
team was not yet assembled. This was acceptable to the management.
He has spent his AIPS++ time on:
<UL>
<LI>Reviewing the calibration/Measurement Equation documents that
have come from Jan Noordam and Tim Cornwell in the last couple
of months.
<LI>Since arriving in Socorro he has begun work with Tim Cornwell
on the design of the Calibration and Imaging Classes for the Generic
Interferometer
</UL>

<P>
Mark has spent 10% of his time on AIPS++ before Sep 8, and 90%
of his time thereafter. His nominal AIPS++ allocation is 50%.
Mark's involvement is negotiated yearly with Narrabri since he
has been seconded to the project from he Narrabri Computer Group.
Currently the agreement is until mid-1996.
<P>
Neil Killeen currently does no actual code work and spends his
AIPS++ time attending to local ATNF AIPS++ management issues.
These include:
<UL>
<LI>Negotiate for AIPS++ specific CSIRO and external funding
<LI>Represent ATNF AIPS++ workers voice to project management
<LI>Interface user community with project
<LI>Interface between AIPS++ project management and ATNF including
negotiating agreements for what the ATNF workers will deliver
<LI>Assist ATNF workers meet their AIPS++ targets
<LI>Interact with other consortium managers
<LI>Organize visit for Tim Cornwell in August
</UL>

<P>
Neil has no nominal AIPS++ time allocation, and the load varies
tremendously. Averaged over the last quarter, Neil has spent 20%
of his time on AIPS++, with peaks of close to 100% in the weeks
before Tim's visit.
<H6>Other activity:</H6>

<P>
Tim Cornwell visited the ATNF for 1 week in August 1995. This
was useful for all parties, and numerous discussions with the
astronomy community were held. In particular, the Parkes multibeam
project is considering using AIPS++ as their software environment.
<P>
The ATNF has CSIRO/IISE AIPS++ demonstrator funding for two 3-year
positions. Currently, we have been allowed to merge these into
one 6 year position in order to make an attractive offer to the
person we would like to hire; he will make a decision soon (early
October). It anticipated that the position will involve visualization
collaboration with the Radiophyics virtual workbench project currently
starting up, as well as serving core AIPS++ needs in the image
analysis and visualization areas.
<H6>Presentations:</H6>

<UL>
<LI>Mark Calabretta gave a presentation describing the AIPS++
project to a CSIRO (Division of Information Technology and Division
of Maths and Statisitics) sponsored Data Processing Languages
meeting
<LI>Neil Killeen made a presentation to a Parkes multibeam project
meeting to help them decide if AIPS++ was an appropriate platform
for their needs. This was a precursor to the discussions held
during Tim's visit.
</UL>

<H4>BIMA</H4>

<P>AIPS++ activity at NCSA during the past
quarter was entirely in the area of continuing development of
visualization software. We are working on two separate visualization
systems. One, called AIPSview, requires only unix, C++, X Window,
and Motif, in order to meet the AIPS++ criterion that no (other)
software which costs money be used. The other, here called Inventor
AIPSview, is built on OpenGL and OpenInventor, for which run-time
licenses are free on SGIs but which cost several hundred dollars
on other platforms. Progress on each tool is described separately.</A>

<H6>AIPSview</H6>

<P>
AIPSview provides display of 2D images, display of any orthogonal
2D slice from a 3D data cube, interactive display of values, coordinates
and line profiles, animated sweeping (movies) through slices along
any dimension, synchronized picking of coordinates, data values,
profiles for multiple data sets, synchronized animated sweeping
of multiple data cubes, blinking between images, a complete colormap
editor, and other features. We completed phases 2 and 3 of our
alpha program (involving AIPS++ and selected external testers)
for this new software tool for two-dimensional visual data analysis,
had an NCSA internal alpha 4 release, and released a beta 1 version,
with source, to the radio astronomy community. We established
a WWW display describing radiosynthesis work at NCSA (<A HREF="http://monet.ncsa.uiuc.edu">http://monet.ncsa.uiuc.edu</A>)
which includes a link to our AIPSview tool; the tool is described,
there is a multi-media tour of AIPSview capabilities, and there
are download capabilities for both executables and source code.
AIPSview source was made available for checkin to AIPS++.
<P>
Specific AIPSview activities included the following:
<OL>
<LI>Bug fixes and miscellaneous minor improvements.
<LI>Implementation of memory mapping of input data file when possible,
in order to reduce memory requirements.
<LI>Implementation of support for blanked data.
<LI>Implementation of improved colormap editor function; AIPSview
now remembers colormaps as they are read in and allows their retrieval
from a menu.
<LI>Modification of AIPSview code to compile under g++.
<LI>Port of AIPSview to AIX, HP-UX and DEC Alpha platforms.
<LI>Release of AIPSview executables for SunOS4, Solaris 2, SGI
Irix, IBM AIX,Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and DEC OSF/1.
<LI>Release of AIPSview source, including development of makefiles
and instructions for all six (see #7) supported systems.
<LI>Design of a data access library which handles
<UL>
<LI>a variety of memory models
<LI>data sets spread across multiple files
<LI>FITS and HDF file formats
<LI>multiple data types
<LI>access to data set attributes
<LI>multivariate and time-series data
</UL>

<LI>Started investigation of using Fermilab Widget in AIPSview
for vector graphics.
</OL>

<P>
11. Demo of AIPSview at BIMA Board meeting, August 26. Preparation
for invited talk and demo of AIPSview and Inventor AIPSview (see
below) at ADASS.
<H6>Inventor AIPSview</H6>

<P>
We have developed a prototype for 3D visual analysis based on
the OpenGL and OpenInventor libraries. Inventor AIPSview allows
full 24-bit color,simultaneous display of multiple data cubes
mixing or matching among simultaneous display modes integrated
into a single view. Display modes include 3D slicing parallel
to the three faces of data cubes, isosurface rendering, contouring,
volumentric rendering, and others. Development during the past
quarter has included a complete change of the GUI to one easier
to use, finishing a volume renderer based on optimized polygon
drawing with transparencies, adding this renderer as a subclass
to the Inventor class libraries, investigating using SGI 3D texture
hardware for volume rendering, updating the slice viewing by integrating
our SvSlice class into an Inventor subclass, updating rendering
intensity as height by integrating our Surface class into an Inventor
subclass, working on some tools to enable easier viewing of 3D,
such as tools that 'rock' the data for volumetric and other data
representations. Inventor AIPSview has been released to NCSA friendly
users. Additionally, we are exploring the design decisions that
must be made in order to use the software across both desktop
flat and stereoscopic displays and advanced virtual environments
such as the CAVE, PowerWall, and ImmersaDesk.

server will remain there. The master AIPS++ installation will
move to the AOC this fall.
<H6>Support</H6>

<P>
All members of the Charlottesville group have made extensive visits
to Green Bank to support the GBT work. In addition, Paul Shannon
visits for two days every week.
<H6>Meetings</H6>

<P>
The group in Socorro is no large enough to support bimonthly technical
meetings. We have just started such a series of talks.
<H4>NFRA</H4>

<P>The local project members: Ger van Diepen
(GVD), Jan Noordam (JEN, local manager), Friso Olnon (FMO), Jayaram
Chengalur (JNC, local Project Scientist).</A> 
<H6>Measurement Equation </H6>

<P>
This quarter has seen the emergence of a matrix-based Measurement
Equation (M.E.) for a generic radio telescope. It seems to open
the way to a truly generic formulation of AIPS++ calibration and
imaging, which will be valid for all existing and planned radio
telescopes. It is based on three related papers (&quot;Understanding
Radio Polarimetry I,II, and III&quot;) by Hamaker, Bregman and
Sault, which have now been accepted by A+A. Noordam has written
a series of AIPS++ Implementation notes on the subject.
<H6>AIPS++ applications </H6>

<P>
Olnon has finished his concept study for a WSRT uv-data `filler',
followed by a detailed design. The latter is `generic', i.e. it
can be used for other telescopes than the WSRT. Implementation
has started.
<H6>AIPS++ Site in Dwingeloo</H6>

<P>
The local AIPS++ installation in Dwingeloo causes very few problems.
Olnon checks the weekly `inhales' and makes small changes in the
configuration where necessary. At the request of the Center he
made a full installation, to test procedures and instructions.
<H6>Infrastructure:Table system </H6>

<P>
Van Diepen continues to work on the Table System, under the guidance
of Brian Glendenning at the Center. The current emphasis is on
the tiled hypercube storage manager. The design is finished, and
implementation has started. In addition, the Table Client for
Glish has been considerably extended. In September, Van Diepen
spent three weeks at the Center in Socorro, as he does regularly.
<H6>Infrastructure: miscellaneous</H6>

<P>
Olnon is responsible for the AIPS++ modules `Utilities' and `Inputs',
in particular the documentation of their public interfaces.
<P>
Van Diepen has devoted some time to the evaluation of QAC++. This
package analyses C++ code to check its compliance with standards.
It also generates various metrics for assessing the complexity
and maintainability of code. This work will continue.
<H6>Miscellaneous</H6>

<P>
NFRA shares with ATNF the cost of sending Mark Wieringa to the
Center, and contributes to the salary of one of the new programmers.
NFRA is still looking for an experienced AIPS++ application programmer,
to strengthen the local team in Dwingeloo.
<P>
NFRA is increasing its general level of experience in the areas
of OOP and C++. All members of the local AIPS++ group and the
TMS project team have been exposed to a C++ course in September.
Olnon has made a draft &quot;C++ Coding Standards at NFRA&quot;.
<P>
Olnon and Van Diepen are members of the NFRA Software Engineering
Group, led by Marco de Vos. Some of the standards and procedures
developed by this group may find their way to the AIPS++ project.
