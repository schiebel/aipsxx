<P>
The sixth public release of AIPS++ (version 1.7) was available July 2002.
AIPS++ is available on CDROM for
Red Hat 7.* and Sun Solaris 2.8, and will be shipped to users or
institutions on request. Please direct e-mail requests for the package
to aips2-request@nrao.edu, and include a complete mailing address. The
v1.7 CDROM ISO images are also available for download at several
high-bandwidth sites within the AIPS++ consortium, as described on the
AIPS++ web page at http://aips2.nrao.edu. This web site can also be
consulted for general information on AIPS++.
<p>
Release v1.7 contains new features in a range of different areas
within the package. These new scientific capabilities are fully
described in the release notes for v1.7, which are available at
(http://aips2.aoc.nrao.edu/docs/project/releasenotes17/releasenotes17.html).
<p>
New users of AIPS++ are encouraged to submit any defects or comments
on the package using our GUI-based defect submission tool, bug(),
which can be invoked at the AIPS++ command-line. We will provide
feedback on any defects which are submitted to the project and we
welcome comments from the user community.
<p>
Effective November 1, Joe McMullin became the NRAO AIPS++ Project
Manager and Kumar Golap became the AIPS++ Deputy Project Manager,
subject to confirmation by the AIPS++ Executive Committee.
Athol Kemball is stepping down to join the NRAO Basic Research staff in
order to focus on his science interests.  We would like to thank Athol
for his outstanding contributions to the AIPS++ Project both technically
and managerially.  His tireless efforts on behalf of the AIPS++ project
have been an inspiration to all project members.  His technical
expertise will be sorely missed, as will his commitment to sound and
effective software project management.
<P>
<h4>Featured science highlight:</h4>
<p>
This is a new feature which will highlight a journal article which has
made use of AIPS++ for analysis.
