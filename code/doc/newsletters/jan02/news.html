AIPS++ is currently in a six-month release cycle. The fifth public
release of the package (version 1.6) was made at the AAS meeting in
Washington D.C. on 6 January 2002. AIPS++ is available on CDROM for
Linux 6.*-7.* and Sun Solaris 2.8, and will be shipped to users or
institutions on request. Please direct e-mail requests for the package
to aips2-request@nrao.edu, and include a complete mailing address. The
v1.6 CDROM ISO images are also available for download at several
high-bandwidth sites within the AIPS++ consortium, as described on the
AIPS++ web page at http://aips2.nrao.edu. This web site can also be
consulted for general information on AIPS++.
<p>
Release v1.6 contains new features in a range of different areas
within the package. These new scientific capabilities are fully
described in the release notes for v1.6, which are available at
(http://aips2.aoc.nrao.edu/docs/project/releasenotes16/releasenotes16.html).
<p>
New users of AIPS++ are encouraged to submit any defects or comments
on the package using our GUI-based defect submission tool, bug(),
which can be invoked at the AIPS++ command-line. We will provide
feedback on any defects which are submitted to the project and we
welcome comments from the user community.
<p>
In August 2001, Joe McMullin moved to Socorro NM to become the AIPS++
deputy project manager. Joe is currently coordinating AIPS++
operations and single-dish development.
