<B>AIPS++</B> and the Green Bank Telescope</FONT></A><BR>
<I>Jim Braatz </I>- NRAO, Green Bank<P>

The final stage of construction on the GBT entails setting the surface
panels, and as of late January 2000 about 75% were in place.
It is anticipated that NRAO will accept the telescope in the Summer of 2000.
After acceptance, there will be a testing and commissioning phase which will 
last through about the end of the year.  As the GBT antenna is taking form, 
so is the software associated with the operation of the telescope.
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> is being used widely in the project for the 
development of engineering 
analysis tools, the observer's interface, and commissioning tools.  In
addition, astronomers will do their analysis work using DISH, an 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>
tool for single-dish data reduction (see the 
<A HREF="../feb99/feb99news.html#article3">February 1999</A> article by Bob
Garwood.)
<P>
The electronics systems for the telescope have been undergoing
testing in a "mock-up" which includes the receivers, LO systems, 
analog filters, and the backends.  In December 1999, the monitor and control 
software and the observer's interface were incorporated into these tests for
the first time.  The tests had the look and feel of a real observing 
experience with the GBT.  Cross scans through a series of radio sources 
were simulated with the Digital Continuum Receiver (DCR) being used
as the backend.  In January 2000, similar integrated-system testing
was done using the spectral processor as the backend.  These procedures
are ongoing and continue to be useful in identifying how the software can
be optimized.
<P>
During the tests, the data were filled into a Measurement Set using a new
on-line filler and then custom <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> tools were used to 
conduct the analysis.
The DCR data, for example, were analyzed using the <TT>commissioning</TT> tool, which is
the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> software to be used for measuring system 
performance and analyzing
continuum data during the GBT's commissioning phase.  Specifically,
the <TT>commissioning</TT> tool will calculate system and antenna 
temperatures, pointing offsets, focus parameters, tracking stability, and 
tipping curves.  The software continues in a development phase as testing
points to procedures which will be required during the actual
commissioning.  The tool uses a custom GUI built in <I>Glish</I>/<TT>Tk</TT>,
though all of the functionality is available from the command line interface
as well.  The infrastructure of DISH is built into the <TT>commissioning</TT> tool,
so many of the techniques translate readily between the two tools.  Figure 1 
shows the Commissioning Tool GUI and Figure 2 shows some results of a simulated cross scan 
plotted on the DISH plotter.
<P>

<P>
<IMG SRC="com3a.gif">
<BR>
<I><B>Figure 2: Simulated Cross Scan Plotted on the DISH Plotter</B></I>
<P>
GBT engineers have been building custom <I>Glish</I> tools for testing of
individual electronics components, as well.  The ease with which 
<I>Glish</I>/<TT>Tk</TT> GUIs can be created and the ability to manipulate data quickly and 
easily are a great asset to the engineers working these tests.  The scope
of the applications ranges from checking the noise characteristics of the 
receivers to tracing the power pulled by the motors as the antenna is moved.  
Figure 3 shows an example of one of the DCR engineering tools; Figure 4, the total 
power seen by two different channels is plotted against time.

<P>
The accuracy of the GBT surface will ultimately rely on the metrology
system, but initially the shape of the surface will be measured and adjusted
using more traditional holography techniques.  The holographic measurements
have an expected accuracy of less than 0.1 mm RMS.   Tests of the holography 
receiver and 
backend were completed this past summer using the 140-ft telescope, and the 
data have been ingested into <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>.  
Existing UNIPOPS scripts have been 
converted into <I>Glish</I>, and now the full suite of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>
 analysis techniques and 
data display programs are available.  A feature of the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> 
<TT>viewer</TT> which 
has been particularly useful in this work is its deft handling of complex 
arrays.  Figure 5 shows a set of data taken in 1986 with the 140-ft 
telescope and displayed with the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> <TT>viewer</TT>.  
The top frame shows the
illumination pattern on the dish seen by the feed, and the bottom frame shows 
the surface deviation from parabolic.  A reference panel about 1 mm in
thickness was placed on the dish and can be seen at 12 o'clock, halfway 
between the center and edge.
<P>

Times are exciting in Green Bank, and the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> project 
looks to play a
vital role in the success of the GBT.  The GBT-specific work described in this
article can be credited primarily to Roger Norrod, Joe McMullin, Bob Garwood, 
Ron Maddalena, and Dana Balser.

<A NAME="glish">
<FONT FACE=helvetica SIZE="+2"><I>Glish</I> as a Scripting Language</FONT>
</A><BR>
<I>Darrell Schiebel </I>- NRAO, Charlottesville

<P>

At the recent <A HREF="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/ADASS/">ADASS IX</A> Conference, a major 
theme was combining scripting with compiled languages to arrive at flexible
data processing systems. This was of particular interest to those involved 
with 
<A HREF="../../aips++.html"><FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT></A> 
because it confirms that  the general approach we adopted in 1994 was the right one. This and future articles 
discuss why this approach is fruitful along with comparisons of scripting languages 
currently in use.
<P>

The three key reasons why this development path was chosen for 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> is because it
allows:
<UL>
<LI>users to develop their own applications;
<LI>rapid prototyping by both developers and users; and 
<LI>the language and the project to develop together.</LI></UL>


<P>
One of the primary goals of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> is to allow users 
to develop their own applications. This goal is not easy to fulfill. There will 
always be users who can make their applications work even under the most trying of 
circumstances, but a large toolkit can elevate the level of interaction so that users 
can manipulate components which are conceptually closer to the types of objects which 
they understand. Too many systems force users to understand the low-level details of the 
system. This has ramifications at many levels. At the most basic level, 
the user would like an interactive way to see function options rather than having to know 
the parameters (and perhaps global variables!) which a function uses. At a higher level, 
the user would like to interact with images rather than having to know details about how 
the image is stored. The availability of a scripting language is the gateway, since it 
allows a  user to write scripts which utilize major components without requiring that the 
user understand the low-level details of these components. To be sure, the user must 
understand the component, but for it to be beneficial, the level of the interaction must be 
close to the level with which the user is comfortable.

<P>
The second goal is related to the first; having a scripting language that allows users 
to interact with components, also  achieves the bonus of having a way for developers to 
prototype applications. The key is to have a mechanism to migrate prototypes, or 
portions of prototypes, to compiled code as the application matures. This is the best of 
both worlds; it allows for a quick start while still permitting an application to mature.


<P>

A final goal is necessary for all systems which combine scripting languages with compiled 
code. There must be some way to integrate seamlessly compiled modules into the scripting 
language as they are developed. All of these goals point toward making the system more 
flexible by giving users the ability to build their own systems by connecting and
 manipulating components. So while these are specific goals which led 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> to  adopt 
<A HREF="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/glish/"><I>Glish</I></A> as its scripting language, 
increasing flexibility is the reason <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> and other projects 
have tended toward scripting languages.

<P>
At the ADASS meeting, three scripting languages were discussed: 
<A HREF="http://www.scriptics.com/resource/">TCL/Tk</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>, and <I>Glish</I>. 
Most of the discussion was about Python, followed by TCL/Tk, and lastly <I>Glish</I>.  
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">Java</A> was also discussed, but not received with as much enthusiasm as
Python and TCL/Tk. A key criterion for adoption seemed to be an existing 
large user base. It seemed to make little difference whether or not the users were scientifically oriented.
Certainly this bias is understandable. Once past the initial hurdles, it 
seems like both developers and users are  happy with the script-based system. In some 
cases, it unifies libraries that lacked a uniform interface. In other cases, it just 
provides users with an interactive layer. In all cases, it seems that the new flexibility 
allows users to accomplish things that wouldn't be possible without the scripting language.

<P>
The next issue in this series on will discuss how these languages are extended and how they 
have been used.

<A NAME="summary">
<FONT FACE=helvetica SIZE="+2">Project News Summary</FONT></A><BR>
<I>Tim Cornwell </I>- NRAO, Socorro

<P>
Since the last newsletter, we made the first public release of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>,
a cause of great satisfaction (and relief!) to those inside the
Project. The official release date was October 4, and the release was
made at the 1999 ADASS in Kona, Hawaii. The release is source code and
binary executables and is thus available only via CD-ROM. The systems
supported are Linux and Solaris, and the bulk of the interest seems to
be in Linux.  We've also received a large number of requests from
non-astronomical institutions, and from private individuals. The
majority of the latter request either Linux or Windows NT (for which a
port is not yet available). We have now exhausted the initial order of
1200 CD-ROMS (400 for each architecture supported), and are in the
process of making new copies. 
<P>
Now that the first release is out, our goal is to settle down to a six
month release cycle, with patches to the existing release issued every
month or so. The development plan for the next release (due April
2000) is available in <A HREF="../../notes/226/226.html">AIPS++ Note 226</A>, 
along with a description of the release process. 
<P>
We have also embarked upon an outreach campaign timed to coincide with
the release. At the AOC in Socorro, we held a series of 6  lectures
entitled <I><B>An Introduction to <FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT></B></I>.  
These were demonstrations of
the use of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> in various contexts, drawing upon the document
<I><B>Getting Started in <FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT></B></I>, and the 
<I><B><FONT FACE=helvetica>AIPS++</FONT> Cookbook</B></I>. 
Attendance was good, 20-30 each day. Following that, Tim Cornwell and Athol 
Kemball
made a tour of various European radio observatories to give talks and
demonstrations. Overall, the reaction has been encouragingly positive.
The first reaction is that <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>
 is apparently powerful but also hard
to learn. The tool-based approach is generally well-received, and the
graphical user interfaces make a favorable first impression.  The
second reaction is that <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>
 has many more uses than traditional
reduction packages (something that we have deliberately designed, of
course). The third major point that we learnt is that the pressure for
a developer's release is higher than we had thought. With this last
point in mind, we are considering the possibility of a developer's
pre-release to be made in the next 6 months or so, targeted just for
Linux platforms.
<P>
We plan to continue this outreach program with similar tutorials at
other consortium sites, and other observatories, and with
presentations at conferences such as the AAS in Atlanta in January
2000.

<FONT FACE=helvetica SIZE="+2"><B><P>AIPS++</B> Under Linux</FONT></A><BR>
<I>Tim Cornwell </I>- NRAO, Socorro<P>


The Linux operating system on Intel-based PCs has become one of the most 
popular <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> development platforms. 
The majority of the NRAO <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> developers 
now use Linux, with a minority using either Solaris/Sparc or SGI/IRIX. 
For this reason one of the main platforms that we targeted for the first 
release was Linux: Red Hat 5.1, 5.2, and SuSE 6.0; and Red Hat 6.0, 6.1, 
and SuSE 6.2.

<P>

The CD-ROMs for these distributions are intended to contain all that is 
needed to run <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>. Thus, if you make 
a standard installation of Linux for these distributions, 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> 
should  easily install  and be ready to run. The 
necessary shared libraries are included on the 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> CD-ROM.  One possible current 
exception is the <TT>lesstif</TT> library, 
as discussed later in this article.

<P>

In the future, we plan to closely track new releases of Linux distributions, 
and minimize the number of versions that we support. We are also considering 
a developer's pre-release that is targeted purely for Linux. Expressions of 
interest in this would be helpful in setting priorities.
<P>
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>Problems with running some Linux versions</B></FONT>
<BR>
Some users have reported that on their system the Red Hat 6.0 and SuSE 6.2 
version of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> cannot be run either 
from the CD-ROM or from disk. The reason is that this version was linked 
against a shared <TT>lesstif</TT> library, 
<TT>libXm.so</TT>. Hence 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> will not run from the CD-ROM or 
from disk unless you have installed Motif (a commerically available product) or 
<TT>lesstif</TT> (available under the GPL).

<P>
If you do not have Motif or <TT>lesstif</TT> 
installed, the easiest fix is to install the 
<TT>lesstif</TT> library from the following  <TT>rpms</TT> 
<TT>lesstif-0.85-1.i386.rpm</TT>
and 
<TT>lesstif-devel-0.85-1.i386.rpm</TT>.

<P>These <TT>rpms</TT> are widely available. 
A copy is available from our server at <TT>aips2.nrao.edu</TT>. 
To install, type  the  following while logged in as root:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>

</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> should then run correctly. 
You should not have to reinstall <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> 
if you have already done so.

<P>
A special area of aperture synthesis imaging, that was explored in detail by 
Dan Briggs in his 1996 Ph.D. thesis, was the use of special algorithms to 
show the structure of ``moderately" resolved radio sources. One that was 
very useful for this purpose was the Non-Negative Least Squares algorithm. 
This algorithm has been implemented as one of the many available for aperture 
synthesis imaging in <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS+</B></FONT>+. I have 
recently used these capabilities to make the best possible images from 
unique data for the 4<SUP>th</SUP> microquasar in our Galaxy, V4641 Sgr. 


<P>

V4641 Sgr is an unusual X-ray transient that had extremely brief X-ray, 
optical, and radio outbursts September 15-16, 1999. When first observed 
with the VLA, only about twelve hours after the X-ray event that produced 
jet ejection, a 0.42 Jy source was obviously resolved in the North-South 
direction. Unfortunately, because the declination of this source is -25 
degrees, the direction of elongation for the jets was only a few degrees 
from the normal elongation of the synthesized beam. Simple analysis of the 
amplitude distribution showed that the main structure should have a size 
scale of 0.25" at a position angle of 162 degrees. Normal imaging and 
deconvolution with the CLEAN algorithm produced a symmetric triple structure, 
with +/- 0.25" components at exactly the beam-related separation where 
CLEAN can introduce spurious structure. In addition, seven radio telescopes 
made multi-frequency radio observations during the first 24 hours of the radio 
event, and the VLA was able to follow it down to a level just above the 
noise at 120  <I>m</I>Jy three weeks later; the fitting of models to the 
light curve data indicated that this was a highly relativistic, ~0.9c, 
superluminal (1.5c) jet source, so one would have expected the radio 
emission to be dominated by one side.



<P>
For normal radio sources, more data clarifies the situation. However, the 
radio event in V4641 was so fast that when the next imaging run was made 
with the VLA 1.9 days later, there was only a weak remnant of about 11 <I>m</I>Jy. 
Most of the 0.42 Jy structure seen in the images for the two eight minute 
scans at 4.9 GHz on September 16 was gone.

<P>

Over the Christmas 1999 holiday week and the first week of 2000 we used 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> NNLS imaging on the irreplaceable 
September 16 event data. The first results were very promising, and by the 
time I went to the Atlanta AAS meeting to present the paper on this object, 
we had images that matched everything we knew about the event. The initial 
structure was dominated by one-sided structure, 0.25" in size - and we  could 
see changes in the central regions of the jet in the images made from data 
only 30 minutes apart.


<P>

<IMG SRC="h_in_v4641_03.gif">


<P>
The images of V4641 Sgr shown above are 1" in size. The two 4.9 GHz images 
at the left were made with the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> 
NNLS function in the <TT>imager</TT> tool using VLA data taken 
September 16.027 and 16.048 UT. In the 30 minutes between those two images 
the total flux dropped from 0.42 to 0.40 Jy and the peak structure spread 
along the direction of motion of the jet. The third image at the right shows 
the result of an image made with <TT>CLEAN</TT> in the 
<TT>imager</TT> tool, using September 
17.94 UT data at 14.9 GHz - for which there was fast position switching 
between V4641 Sgr and a calibrator 22' away. This radio image shows the 
location of the weak decaying radio source that was observed at this 
position until it was not detectable after 1999 October 7.  This image 
sequence shows that the September 16 radio emission was one-sided jet 
ejection at a position angle of 162 degrees.

<P>

Without any complicated analysis, these images show that the initial jet 
ejection was highly relativistic and one-sided with a size scale of 0.25" 
attained about 12 hours after the associated X-ray events. This is because, 
while V4641 Sgr is a superluminal jet source like GRS 1915+105, GRO J1655-40, 
and XTE J1748-288, unlike these sources which are 12, 3, and 8 kpc away, 
V4641 Sgr is very close - only 0.5 kpc away.

<P>

It is very gratifying to be able to go beyond the testing of capabilities 
that have been available in other data processing systems to using some of 
the more advanced algorithms which are easily developed in 
<FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>.

<P>
A primary focus has been identifying and correcting defects in preparation for the 
public release of <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT>.
 The stability of the system was been improved during this process. 
An additional effort has been undertaken to standardize the appearance of 
GUI's so that they meet the newly established project GUI guidelines.

<P>
The project web pages and documentation have continued to be improved in layout, 
content and through the addition of new pages and references. The 
<I><B>ClearDDTS</B></I> defect-tracking system  has been fully integrated into the 
web documentation. A first edition of a cookbook for scientific users has been 
produced, covering a range of data reduction capabilities in the package.

<P>
The Display Library and the Viewer application have received  extensive enhancements 
in several areas,  including display event handling (eg. motion or position), 
coordinate support, panning and zooming, RGB/HSV development and extension of 
the capabilities of the Postscript canvas.

<P>
In imaging and deconvolution applications, new algorithms are now supported  
including MEM in imager, multi-scale multi-field deconvolution, and wide-field or 
multi-field Hogbom CLEAN. Improvements have been made in the computational efficiency 
of several algorithms, and in deconvolution progress displays. New test functions have 
been added to verify that correctness of the algorithms.  
The <TT>simpleimage</TT> application has been upgraded 
and now can be  launched from the tool manager. The wide-field facet calculation 
algorithm has been improved. An initial version of single-dish data gridding has been 
added, along with preliminary support for holography and "on-the-fly" (OTF) data types.

<P>
The tool manager has received a large number of refinements and upgrades to improve 
window handling, expand the capabilities and to support new GUI data entry widgets. 
The library of standard GUI widgets has been improved and extended.

<P>
A number of changes have been made to the <TT>Image</TT> 
tool. The constructors  <TT>shapetoimage()</TT>
and <TT>arraytoimage()</TT> will now make an appropriate 
coordinate system  if at all possible, rather than just a simple linear in each 
dimension. Computation of flux statistics has been added, as well as new capabilities 
in image concatenation, functions to Fourier transform an image, progress displays 
in areas such as histogram computation, and initial support for image polarimetry. 
The image component fitter now allows both a model and aclip range, and can include 
or exclude the pixel ranges to be used in fitting. The function 
<TT>fit2d()</TT> has been renamed to 
<TT>fitsky()</TT>.


<P>
The Parkes multi-beam software has been revised and improved in a  number of areas.

<P>In single-dish development, significant effort has gone into expanding the GBT 
data fillers to support a wide variety of back-end data formats and data-associated 
parameter (DAP) files. The commissioning tools for the GBT have been extended, as 
there have been numerous improvements to the Dish GUI and its functions.

<P>
The VLA filler has undergone extensive development during this period, including 
new support for auto-correlation data, IF status flags, reading from tape or disk, 
and the correction of scaling errors. Data loading from remote tapes is now supported. 
A number of new  features have also been added to the 
<TT>RPFITS</TT> filler.

<P>
The <TT>measures</TT> software now has new 
<TT>FITS</TT> conversion utilities, and also has 
undergone general improvements.

<I>Glish</I> now supports an option to be built with the Boehm-Demers-Wesier 
automatic garbage collection system.

<P>
The <TT>UVFITS</TT> capabilities for reading and 
writing have been improved for multi-source data files, 
<TT>GC</TT> and 
<TT>TY</TT> sub-tables, and in support for a 
broader range of <TT>FITS</TT> parameters.

<P>
The visibility plotter <TT>visplot</TT> 
has had improvements in the area of data selection, robustness, and speed.

<P>
Support for calculating the standard flux densities provided by the Perley-Taylor 
coefficients has been added to <TT>imager</TT> as the 
function <TT>setjy()</TT>. The 
<TT>calibrater</TT> tool has a new function to plot 
calibration solutions (<TT>plotcal</TT>), and also 
to establish overall flux density scales 
(<TT>fluxscale</TT>). Calibration selection using 
<TT>FIELD_ID</TT> is also now  available.

<P>
Component model support has been improved through the identification and 
correction of some defects, and the addition of new capabilities.

<P>
The <B>NFRA</B> software supporting the commissioning of the Telescope Management 
System (<TT>TMS</TT>) has been further developed in a 
number of areas.

<P>
The simulator has been revised to work from an MS, and it now allows the addition of a 
broader range of physically meaningful calibration errors.

<P>
In the system area, a new utility, <TT>checker</TT>, 
has been added to verify that the <FONT FACE=helvetica><B>AIPS++</B></FONT> 
environment is suitable for running specified packages. The memory allocation 
infrastructure has been updated, a new combined server has been added to reduce 
memory use, and the parallelization code has been updated to track other changes 
in the library.

<P>
An initial version of an  editing tool, <TT>flagger</TT>, has been added to the system.


<P>
The <TT>catalog</TT> tool has been improved in several areas, 
including showing a busy cursor when making lists, recognizing graphics formats 
correctly, and handling of the image viewer.

<P>
The table system has been improved in several areas. A new function, 
<TT>addColumns()</TT>, has been added and the 
support for measures  in tables has been extended.
