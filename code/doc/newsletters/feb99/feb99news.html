ACSIS (Auto-Correlation Spectrometer Imaging System)
</B></FONT></A>
<BR>
<I>Tony Willis</I> - DRAO, Penticton<P>


The ACSIS (Auto-Correlation Spectrometer Imaging System), which will provide a 
spectral line imaging capability for the JCMT telescope in Hawaii,
is designed to receive data from a 16-feed focal plane array. The 
correlator for each feed will have the  capability  of producing a 
new 8192 channel spectrum every 50 milliseconds. The system must be able 
to observe for a total of six minutes between calibrations. 
This means that the reduction 
computers must be able to store and process up to 3.8 Gbytes (16 x 8192 x 
4 x 20 x 360) of data every six minutes. After a 6 minute scan has been 
calibrated, it will be sent to an on-the-fly gridder; the reduction computer 
will then begin handling the next scan.

<P>

The budget for the reduction and gridding computers is small, about 
$160,000 U.S. The only way we expect to handle this amount of data within 
this computing budget is to use a distributed processing system consisting 
of commodity-priced components (i.e. PCs or alpha workstations). However, 
the rate at which data must be passed between these machines is high. 
Initial tests with a toy system have used a 100 Mbit ethernet. However the 
final system may need to use Gbit ethernet, fiberchannel, or Myrinet to 
carry the expected traffic.


<P>

This high data rate forces us to make a critical decision. The current 
implementation of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> uses <I>Glish</I> 
clients in a 'hidden' way to add extra programming functionality to 
<I>Glish</I>. The clients coexist with <I>Glish</I> on the same machine 
and all data flow between clients passes through the <I>Glish</I> 
interpreter. However, that data flow rate is unacceptable for the ACSIS 
application. Tests, using a Sun 200 MHz dual processor UltraSPARC, show
that if client1 sends 100000 spectra each containing 8192 floating point 
numbers to client2, via the <I>Glish</I> interpreter, the system takes
approximately 1 hour 20 minutes to digest the 100000 incoming spectra, 
and the second client only manages to catch approximately 57000 
spectra by that time. (I'll also admit I got fed up with waiting for 
measuring how long it would take the second client to get all 100000 
spectra and did a <TT>ctrl-C</TT> at this point!)


<P>

However, the <I>Glish</I> designers anticipated this situation, and provide 
a link operator which enables one client to directly communicate with another 
client without going via the <I>Glish</I> interpreter. Use of the link 
operator dramatically reduces the time required for client1 to send 100000 
spectra to client2, and have client2 catch all 100000 spectra, to a bit more 
than a minute! This corresponds to a data transfer rate of about 50 Mbit per 
second, which is quite acceptable.


<P>

Because the JCMT currently uses a package called 
<A HREF="http://www.jach.hawaii.edu/jcmt_sw/drama/html/DramaIntro.frames.html">DRAMA</A> for message passing 
between tasks, we also needed to make sure that <I>Glish</I> could transfer 
data between tasks at a rate at least comparable to that of DRAMA before we 
could argue that <I>Glish</I> should be used for data reduction. Our 
measurements show that data messages passed via the <I>Glish</I> link 
method are usually transferred at least as fast as DRAMA messages, and 
sometimes the <I>Glish</I> data rate surpassed that of DRAMA. Other factors 
influencing the choice of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>/<I>Glish</I> 
include 
the rich class library that has been developed for 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> and the expectation that 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> will provide a powerful package for 
post-observation analysis of single dish data in the next couple of years.


<P>

The following <I>Glish</I> script gives an example of how a toy 
system for ACSIS data reduction might work.  Assume I have three computers 
available for use: <I><B>castor</B></I> and <I><B>pollux</B></I>, which are 
both dual processor 200MHz ultraSPARC machines, and <I><B>jcmtdual</B></I>, 
a dual processor 266 MHz PII PC running <I>Linux</I>.


<P>

I start the script on <B><I>castor</I></B>. I first launch a <I>Glish</I> 
client called <TT>drama_to_glish</TT>. This client, as its name suggests, 
will listen for DRAMA messages and convert them to <I>Glish</I> events. 
This translator is necessary since the JCMT observing system that collects 
the raw data will still use the DRAMA system and the raw correlator data 
will arrive as DRAMA messages.  (Thanks are due Darrrell Schiebel and 
Tony Farrell (Anglo_Australian Telescope) for their 
assistance in getting this translator running properly.) 


<P>

I then launch six data processor clients, two on each of the three machines 
available to me. The <TT>setup</TT>, <TT>step,</TT> and <TT>initialize</TT> 
events contain messages telling the data processor clients how the data will
 be reduced. Since the reduction methods are expected to be identical on all 
clients, I use multiple calls to the <TT>link_proc</TT> function to cause 
these events to be directly broadcast  from the <TT>drama_to_glish</TT> 
converter to all data processor clients. 


<P>

I then arrange for the six streams of data events to get directly sent from 
the <TT>drama_to_glish</TT> converter to a data_processing client. Each data 
event contains a <I>Glish</I> record with 8192 floatng point numbers of 
correlator lag data.


<P>

The following is the <I>Glish</I> script to perform the necessary operations.

<P>

And away we go. The toy system has a DRAMA program which first sends various 
setup and initialization messages which are caught and converted by the 
<TT>drama_to_glish</TT> client. The DRAMA task then sends a stream of 8192 
data vectors which are converted into <I>Glish</I> records by 
<TT>drama_to_glish</TT> and sent out to the various re-execution clients.


<P>

The fact that <I>Glish</I> clients only respond to and create events without 
knowing where these events are coming from or going to, with the interaction 
between events and clients being defined by the <I>Glish</I> script, provides 
additional flexibility. If we wanted to add more processing machines with 
more <I>Glish</I> clients, it would be a simple exercise to modify the above 
script to handle that situation. DRAMA clients, on the other hand, send or 
receive events from other specifically labeled clients. More work would be 
involved in modifying the client programs to add in message passing to the 
new machines and clients.

Testing of AIPS++

<BR>
<I>Tim Cornwell</I> - NRAO, Socorro

<P>

In order to develop a robust system, we must test it often and thoroughly, 
and ensure that the results of the testing are acted on expeditiously. 
I thought that readers of our newsletter might be interested in how we test 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>. You should also regard this as a request 
for help, please read on....

<P>

We currently test <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> in five different ways:
<P>

<DL><DD>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>1.  C++ unit testing</B> </FONT><BR>
Specially written C++ test programs are compiled and run weekly. 
Typically, all classes in the reviewed code pass this test all the time. 
Unreviewed code, such as the synthesis code, does not always have test 
programs. The impact of this is lessened considerably by two factors: 
first, most of the code has been used for many months, and secondly that 
<I>Glish</I>-based testing catches a number of errors.

<P>
<DD>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>2.  <I>Glish</I> script testing</B></FONT><BR>
Scripts written in <I>Glish</I> exercise the system by testing, for example, 
all functions in a tool.

<P>
<DD>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>3.  Direct user testing</B></FONT><BR>
We ask users to exhaustively test all the functionality in some area. 
An example, would be that we ask someone to test all functions in the single 
dish analysis application, <TT>dish</TT>, and report on bugs and suggestions 
for more functionality.

<P>
<DD>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>4. Un-directed user testing</FONT></B><BR>
Users test the system either while exploring it or while using it to process 
data. The use of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> at the GBT, WSRT, and 
Parkes has been invaluable in this respect for certain parts of 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> such as the Table system and 
<I>Glish</I>. Other parts of the system, such as the synthesis package, 
have seen much less exercise.

<P>
<DD>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>5.  Build and Smoke Testing</FONT></B><BR>
To improve project-wide awareness of the <I>Glish</I> script testing, we now 
perform so-called "Build and Smoke Tests" three times a week. This practice 
is commonplace for Microsoft and other commercial software vendors. As 
described in an IEEE software article (<I>Best Practices</I>, IEEE Software, 
Vol 13, No. 4, July 1996), the important thing is to make it so that: 
"Every file is compiled, linked, and combined into an executable program 
every day, and the program is then put through a 'smoke test,' a relatively 
simple check to see whether the product 'smokes' when it runs."


<P>

Our "smoke test" is to run the <EM>assay</EM> script, which executes a number 
of <I>Glish</I>-based test scripts within the typical user environment. For 
logistic reasons, we do this three times a week instead of daily. 
The summarized results are then mailed to our aips2-lib mail exploder so that 
if the system "smokes," everyone can see who is responsible. This 
accomplishes two objectives: first, developers are kept aware of the 
current state of the system, as it would be experienced by users, and second, 
peer-pressure is utilized to minimize breakages.

</DL>

<P>

Our pool of local users and external beta-testers help us with the user 
testing. We are always looking to expand this pool. If you are willing to 
help, please contact Tim Cornwell (<a href="mailto:tcornwel@nrao.edu">tcornwel@nrao.edu</a>) or Athol Kemball (<a href="mailto:akemball@nrao.edu">akemball@nrao.edu</a>).

DISH: The Single Dish Environment AIPS++
</FONT></B></A>
<BR>
<I>Bob Garwood </I>- NRAO, Charlottesville

<P>

DISH is a collection of <I>Glish</I> scripts and clients that provide 
an environment within <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> which is intended to 
be used for single dish radio astronomy data analysis.  Its initial aim is to 
be a worthy replacement for traditional single dish analysis programs such as 
UniPOPS.  Eventually it will provide access to more advanced data calibration 
and imaging utilities that will share the same basic design as the synthesis 
calibration and imaging utilities in <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>. The 
primary design goal has been to provide a graphical user interface that is 
intuitive, unsurprising, and responsive.  Users should feel that results go 
to obvious places and, whenever possible, are displayed as they occur.  
To use DISH, simply include <TT>dish.g</TT> after starting up 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>.

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>The DISH Graphical User Interface (GUI)</B></FONT>
<BR>

The following figure shows the major components of the DISH GUI.

<P>
<CENTER>
<A HREF="dishfig1.gif"><IMG SRC="dishfig1a.gif">
<BR><I>Click on image to obtain a larger view</I></A>
</CENTER>
<P>

The Results Manager is the core of DISH.  All <I>Glish</I> variables created 
by DISH, in response to user actions, are stored in the Results Manager.  
These variables are available for the user to interact with at the 
<I>Glish</I> command line. DISH immediately plots the currently selected 
variable - if it can be plotted.  A description is associated with each 
variable.  The user can change the description or the name of a variable 
in the Results Manager.  Certain variables can also be browsed.  All 
variables can be further inspected.

<P>

The Menu bar at the top of the DISH GUI provides access to the 
<I><B>File</B></I>, <B><I>Operations</I></B>, <B><I>Help</I></B> and other 
features of DISH.  New data files are created and 
existing data files are opened through the <I><B>File</B></I> menu.  
The GUI panels for 
each available operation are enabled and dismissed through the 
<I><B>Operations</B></I>
menu.  Multiple operation panels may be present at any time although screen 
size limitations are generally such that only a few will typically be 
displayed at one time.  When enabled, each operation panel appears at the 
bottom of the DISH window.  The operation shown in the above figure is for 
fitting baselines to the currently displayed spectra.  Other operations 
include: applying selection criteria, averaging, smoothing, applying a 
user defined function, re-gridding, multi-operation sequences, saving data, 
and writing the data out in x, y columns in an ASCII file.


<P>


The most recent status message is shown in the text immediately below the 
Results Manager.  Messages displayed here are also echoed to the
AIPS++ Logger window.

<P>

Operations within DISH may operate on collections of scans or they may 
operate on individual scans.  All operations place their results in the 
Results Manager.  If the result can be displayed, it is. Operations on 
individual scans always operate on the most recently displayed scan so that, 
hopefully, the user is not confused as to what is being operated on.

<P>

Each time <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> is exited while DISH is running, 
the current state of DISH is saved to disk.  This state includes all of the 
contents of the Results Manager as well as the parameter values for the 
operations and user interface preferences.  DISH is restored to this state 
when it is restarted.

<P>


<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>Getting Data into DISH</B></FONT>

<BR>

In order to use DISH, you must first get data into an 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> table that DISH can interact with.  
At the moment, DISH interacts with data which has been converted from a 
Single Dish FITS binary table (SD-FITS) into an 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> table.  In the future, DISH will interact 
directly with an <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> MeasurementSet.

<P>

To convert from SD-FITS to an <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> table, 
use the <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> utility program 
<TT>fits2table</TT> at the UNIX prompt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
fits2table input=SDFITS_file_name output=output_table_name
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>

UniPOPS users must first convert the UniPOPS FITS to a valid SD-FITS file.  
UniPOPS FITS represents an early state of the SD-FITS convention.  It has a 
few different features from that found in the final SD-FITS convention.  
The utility program <TT>uni2sdfits</TT> does this conversion:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
uni2sdfits input=UniPOPS_fits_file_name 
           output=SDFITS_file_name
  
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

An <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> MeasurementSet containing single dish 
data can be converted to a SD-FITS file using the <TT>ms2sdfits</TT> utility 
program:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
ms2sdfits ms_name fits_name
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>Using the DISH Command Line Interface</B></FONT>

<BR>
No matter how sophisticated a GUI may be, there will always be things which a 
user will want to do which can not be done with that GUI. Also, as users 
become more sophisticated, they will often want to write their own scripts 
using some of the same operations that are available in the GUI.  All of the 
operations done through the GUI are also available at the <I>Glish</I> 
command line.  The Trace Tool, when activated, shows these underlying 
<I>Glish</I> commands as each GUI operation occurs.  These can be used to 
learn how the DISH GUI works, or the text from that window can be copied to 
an editor and used as the starting point for a <I>Glish </I>script.


<P>

All of the values in the Results Manager can be manipulated at the 
<I>Glish</I> command line.  These results can then be returned to the 
Results Manager.  In this way, users can do things not available in DISH 
and return the results to DISH for further processing.  
The recipe that follows  shows a simple example illustrating this.

<P>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Conclusion</B></FONT>: 
This is a simple example.  
Addition operations could be done to check that this operation was 
appropriate for this data, to scale the data, etc.  The whole range of 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> utilities are available at the <I>Glish</I> command line for use on results known to DISH.  Any <I>Glish</I> value can be 
stored in the Results Manager.  This will preserve it, along with the results 
of the contents of the Results Manager, between invocations of DISH.

<P>
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>Future Plans</B></FONT><BR>

For the first full release of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>  operations 
such as multi-component fitting and FFTs will be added to DISH.  DISH will be 
able to interact with an <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> MeasurementSet.  
The command line interface will be cleaned up so that users can more easily 
insert their own specialized operations into DISH.


<P>

The long range plan for single dish calibration and imaging in 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> is to follow the same model used for 
synthesis data within <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> 
<A HREF="http://www.nrao.edu/~akemball/1000.ps">(Kemball 1999)</A>.  
An initial test of single dish 
calibration is expected in early 1999.  An on-the-fly single dish imaging 
tool is planned for later in 1999.

We are still working towards an <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>  release 
within the next few months. We plan to freeze the working code on 15 March 
1999, and make a release once testing is complete (see the article on 
<A HREF="#article2"><I>Testing of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT></I></A> 
for more information). 
Following the third beta release last October we made two stable releases, 
one in November and one in January. A stable release is any weekly build of 
the system that passes all the relevant automated tests. It is therefore less 
of a milestone than a beta (for which more rigorous and comprehensive 
hands-on testing is done), but does serve to provide a stable platform 
for our alpha and beta testers.

<P>

In November, we held a meeting of our internal applications developers in 
Socorro to discuss and plan the integration of the various applications that 
have been developed. This was basically a tidying-up effort with the goals of 
ensuring that we use common components in our applications (especially the 
user interfaces) and that the applications can exchange high-level 
information in a straightforward way. Both goals were accomplished, as was 
planning of the final deliverables in the first release. One particularly 
nice example of an <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> application is the 
<B><I>imagefitter</I></B> put together by Neil Killeen.  This uses a number of 
separate <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> tools: the <TT>image</TT> 
tool to access the an image; the <TT>regionmanager</TT> tool to denote 
the region to be fitted; <I><B>least squares</B></I> classes to perform 
the fitting; the 
<A HREF="../../../docs/newsletters/nov98/octnews/octnews.html">
<B><I>display library</I></B></A>
 to display the results; the <B><I>componentmodels</I></B> to hold the 
results; 
and finally, <I>Glish</I> to coordinate and control all of these. Such an 
application relies upon and tests all the work that we have put into 
developing the <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> infrastructure. Another 
important push that has resulted from the integration meeting is to make one 
final round of improvements to the user interface, streamlining the flow of 
information around the interface. These improvements are being evaluated by 
our alpha testers.

<P>

We gave a number of presentations at the recent ADASS meeting in 
Champaign-Urbana. Athol Kemball gave a talk on the design of the synthesis 
calibration software, and a number of posters were presented on various 
aspects of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>. Demonstrations were given for 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> and the parallel code running on an NCSA 
SGI Origin 2000. In addition, Athol Kemball and Joe McMullin attended the 
AAS meeting in Austin and gave similar demonstrations at the NRAO booth. 
We expect this to be a regular event at future AAS meeting. In particular, 
at the Chicago meeting in June 1999, we expect to be able to hand out
CD-ROMs containing the first release of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>.

<P>

Finally, you can see a <A HREF="http://aips2.nrao.edu/docs/html/tour/index.htm">tour of <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> 
capabilities</a> from our home page. This is based upon the presentations 
given at ADASS and the AAS.

The Tiled Storage Managers for AIPS++ Tables</A>

</FONT><BR>
<I>Ger van Diepen </I> - NFRA, Dwingeloo

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>Introduction</B></FONT>
<BR>
The previous newsletter contained an article about the basic <A HREF="../../../docs/newsletters/nov98/octnews/octnews.html#TABLE"><FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> Table System</A>. Each table uses storage managers to store the 
data of a table column on disk. One important storage manager is the Tiled 
Storage Manager (TSM). This article gives some background information about 
the TSM and explains its properties and where it is used. It is primarily 
meant for the technically oriented reader, but may give some insights to the 
casual reader.

<P>

In several packages image access in the X-direction is very fast, in the 
Y-direction it is possible but rather slow, while in the Z-direction it is 
very slow if possible at all. It was felt that a mechanism was needed to 
make accessing images in all directions almost equally fast, e.g. getting 
a spectrum out of an image cube should be easily possible. A well-known 
technique for solving this problem is to store the data in a tiled way 
instead of a linear way. It is used successfully in some modern packages 
(e.g. <I>Karma</I>). It was decided to make use of this technique in the 
<FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> Table System by developing the 
Tiled Storage Manager.

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>TSM Tiling</B></FONT><BR>

The TSM stores its data in so-called tiles. Each tile is a regular subset of 
the entire data array. For example, an array of 64*64 pixels can be divided 
in 4 quadrants of 32*32 pixels. Each quadrant can be seen as a tile. When 
writing the array into a file each tile is stored linearly instead of storing 
the entire array linearly. A tile is read/written with one I/O request, so 
its size should be large enough, but not too large. A typical size is 32K 
pixels.


<P>

By sizing the tile dimensions in an appropriate way it is possible to access 
the data equally efficient in all directions, e.g., with an image cube of 
1024*1024*64 pixels, the tile size could be chosen as 64*64*8 pixels. 
Then 16*16*8 tiles are needed for the entire cube. To read a vector in the 
X-direction the TSM needs to read 16 tiles. For the next vector the same 16 
tiles are needed. This leads to the idea of using a cache containing enough 
tiles to avoid unnecessary reading, which is what the TSM does. It assumes 
that sequential access is done, and based on the first access it tries to 
size its cache such that it can hold all tiles necessary to read each tile 
only once. It is also possible for the user to give the access pattern 
beforehand so the TSM can calculate the optimal cache size. It can be seen 
that accessing a vector in the Y-direction also requires 16 tiles, so access 
in X- or Y-direction is about equally fast. In the Z-direction only 8 tiles 
are needed for a vector.


<P>

Only a 3-dimensional example is discussed above. The TSM can, however, handle 
any dimensionality. By default the tile size will be set so that about the 
same number of tiles is needed in all dimensions. It will always try to fit 
an integral number of tiles in each dimension. Tiles have the same length to 
make it easy to find them in the file. Since the remainder of the last tile 
is stored on disk, the remainder should be as small as possible to avoid 
waste.

<P>

It is also possible to set the tile size explicitly. Of course, you can set 
the tile size such that access in one direction is (much) faster than another 
direction. In the above example the tile size could be defined as 1024*32*1 
which means that the data is effectively stored in a linear way. Access in X 
will be very fast, but in Z it will be tremendously slow.

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>TSM Cache</B></FONT><BR>

A package like <I>Karma</I> uses the virtual memory mechanism of the OS as 
its cache by mapping the data file into virtual memory. In this way the page 
table acts as the cache controller. It has the advantage that no special 
software needs to be written to maintain a cache and to calculate optimal 
cache sizes. It has, however, two important disadvantages:

<OL>
<LI>In a networked system it may well be possible that the data is written on 
a SUN and read on a DEC Alpha with reversed byte ordering. A package like 
<I>Karma</I> circumvents this problem by reading the entire file into memory 
(thus swap space) while reversing the byte order. <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> images can be very large, which makes this solution impossible for the 
general case. Note that, as with all other storage managers, the TSM stores 
the data in a canonical format to ensure that the data can easily be read 
from machines with different byte orderings or even different floating point 
representations. The canonical format is big-endian ordering and IEEE 
floating point. 

<LI>The OS will not be able to predict which tiles will be needed next. 
Usually the TSM can predict that very well making it possible to pre-fetch 
tiles. In the current system this possibility is not yet exploited, but it 
in the future it will be.
</OL>

<P>

It was therefore decided that a TSM should have its own cache. The size of 
the cache is the number of slots; each slot contains a tile with its data in 
local format (thus conversion from canonical to local format is done when 
reading a tile). When accessing data the TSM looks to see if the tile is in 
the cache. If not, it removes a tile from the cache and reads the required 
tile into the freed slot. At the moment it uses the least-recently-used 
algorithm to free a slot. In the future it may be possible to use other 
algorithms.

<P>

It is very important that the cache size is not too small. One tile which is 
too little can make a huge difference in performance. To assist the 
programmer in analyzing the behavior of the cache, the TSM keeps statistics 
and has functions to show and clear these statistics.
<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>The Various Tiled Storage Managers</B></FONT><BR>

A table column can be bound to a TSM, so all data in that column is stored in 
a tiled manner. A TSM stores the data of the column in one or more so-called 
hypercubes. Each hypercube is fully regular, thus the data arrays from the 
rows stored in a hypercube has the same shape. But since there can be more 
than one hypercube for a TSM, it is possible that the column can have 
irregularly shaped data in its rows. For example, a MeasurementSet can 
contain line data and continuum data. Each row contains the data for all 
polarizations and channels, so a row of line data has shape 4*128 and a row 
of continuum data has shape 4*1. They can be stored in two different 
hypercubes, one for line and one for continuum data. In fact, both hypercubes 
can have their own tile size.


<P>

Four flavors of the TSM have been developed, each with its own behavior regarding the data array shapes:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>The <TT><B>TiledColumnStMan</B></TT> is most strict. It requires that the 
data have the same shape in all rows, so it can only be used if the 
table column is defined with the <TT>FixedShape</TT> attribute. So all data 
is stored in only one hypercube. 

<LI>The <TT><B>TiledCellStMan</B></TT> is least strict. It uses one hypercube 
per row, thus the data in each row can be differently shaped.

<LI>The <TT><B>TiledShapeStMan</B></TT> is a mixture of the previous flavors. 
It creates a new hypercube when the data in a row has a shape that has not 
been used before. So in the MeasurementSet example above it would 
automatically create two hypercubes. 

<LI>The <TT><B>TiledDataStMan</B></TT> is similar to the <TT><B>TiledShapeStMan</B></TT>. The only difference is that the hypercube is not chosen 
automatically, but the user has full control over the creation of hypercubes. 
So the user may decide to use different hypercubes, even if the data shape 
is the same. It needs a special id-column (e.g. spectral window id) to make 
the choice.
</UL>

<P>

All TSM's, except <TT><B>TiledDataStMan</B></TT>, are in principle completely 
transparent to the user. Once a column is bound to a TSM, the user does not 
need to be aware if a TSM is used, or a more regular storage manager like 
<TT><B>StManAipsIO</B></TT>. <TT><B>TiledDataStMan</B></TT> is different, 
because it requires the programmer to call some specific functions to create 
and extend the hypercubes. This was felt to be cumbersome, therefore this 
storage manager is somewhat outdated and has been replaced by the newer 
<TT><B>TiledShapeStMan</B></TT>. 

<P>

<FONT FACE=HELVETICA><B>AIPS++ Experiences</B></FONT><BR>

In the <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> project the TSM is used 
successfully in two important cases:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Images (usually 3D) are stored using the <TT><B>TiledCellStMan</B></TT>. 
In general, it  has proven to be a very successful technique. Access in the 
X-direction is slower than in a package like <I>Miriad</I>, but in the Y- 
and especially in the Z-direction it is so much faster that the slower 
X-access is not seen as a real disadvantage. In many cases (e.g. when 
calculating the mean or adding two images) the order of access to an image 
is not important. In such cases the data is accessed tile by tile, which 
ensures that the cache needs only one tile and that access efficiency is
 optimal. Reading or writing an image in this way gives very good 
performance. For example, on an UltraSparc2 adding two 8 Mb images and storing the result in a third one takes less than 2 seconds elapsed time. 

<LI>The data and flags in a MeasurementSet are usually stored via a TSM in 
3D tiles with axes for polarization, frequency and time/baseline. Sometimes 
the last dimension is separated, resulting in 4D tiles. The tiling makes 
it possible that, for example, time-baseline plots are as fast as 
frequency-time plots. The TSM makes it possible to avoid expensive sort 
steps, as used in other packages.
</OL>

<P>

The various fillers decide which TSM flavor is used. For example, the 
WSRT filler uses the <TT><B>TiledColumnStMan</B></TT>, while others use 
<TT><B>TiledDataStMan</B></TT> or <TT><B>TiledShapeStMan</B></TT>.

<P>

The <I><B>Lattice</B></I> and <I><B>Image</B></I> classes are fully based on 
the TSM. They contain several classes to iterate through an image in the 
most efficient way. These classes (e.g. <B><I>LatticeApply</I></B>, 
<B><I>LatticeIterator</I></B>, <B><I>LatticeNavigator</I></B>)  have proven 
to be very useful, because sometimes it is hard to formulate the correct 
mental picture on how to set the optimal cache size for a particular access 
pattern.

<I>Athol Kemball</I> - NRAO, Socorro<P>

This article is the second in a series concerning synthesis reduction
in <I>AIPS++</I>.  It considers the Measurement Equation (ME) in more
detail and describes the correspondence between ME components and 
more traditionally defined
calibration quantities. As pointed out in
the first article in this series, the ME does not represent any new
physics, but is simply a formulation of the interferometry equations that is sufficiently
general to allow calibration and imaging for a generic instrument.
It also suggests new and more correct forms of data
reduction. The reader is referred to the series of articles by
Hamaker, Bregman and Sault (1996), Sault, Hamaker and Bregman (1996),
Hamaker and Bregman (1996), and Hamaker (1998) for more details.
<P>
We discuss here the implementation of the ME within <I>AIPS++</I> (Noordam
1995; Cornwell 1995), and first consider some preliminaries. A generic
interferometer is considered to measure a four-vector of
cross-correlations <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline270" SRC="img1.gif"> between two recorded polarizations
(<I>p</I>,<I>q</I>) for each of two feeds (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) characterizing an individual
baseline. This measured vector includes instrumental calibration
effects and is denoted by:
<P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH="500">
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="equation1.gif">
</TD><TD>(1)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The ME relates the measured vector <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline270" SRC="img1.gif"> to the true polarized sky
brightness, <IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline278" SRC="img3.gif">, which is expressed in a Stokes basis as:

<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="equation2.gif">
</TD><TD>(2)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Different instrumental and propagation effects are modeled in the ME
as calibration components and take the form of four-by-four matrices,
acting on four-vectors of the type given above.  The calibration
components are sub-divided into two general categories based on whether they
act in the image- or uv-plane. Calibration components which are
feed-based are constituted as the direct matrix product of separate
two-by-two Jones matrices for each feed on the baseline under
consideration, as:

<TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH="500">
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="equation3.gif">
</TD><TD>(3)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<P>
Provision is also made for multiplicative and additive baseline-based
calibration components, which are not decomposed into feed-based
terms.  The calibration matrices are expressed in the polarization
basis (<I>p</I>,<I>q</I>) of the feed, which may typically be circular or linear. For
reference, the direct matrix product of two matrices is defined as:
<P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH="500">
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="equation4.gif">
</TD><TD>(4)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The full ME including image-plane and uv-plane calibration effects can
be defined in terms of the quantities described above as:
<P>
<BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 WIDTH=500>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="equation5.gif"></TD><TD>(5)</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>
<P>
where:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <IMG WIDTH=106 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline282" SRC="img8.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=38 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline284" SRC="img9.gif"> are the individual n-th
uv-plane and m-th image-plane calibration components respectively;
<LI> <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline286" SRC="img10.gif"> denotes direction, and <IMG WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline288" SRC="img11.gif"> denotes the
interferometer baseline vector;
<LI> the matrix <I>S</I> converts the sky brightness Stokes polarization
basis to the polarization basis used in the interferometer
itself; and
<LI> <IMG WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline292" SRC="img12.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline294" SRC="img13.gif"> denote multiplicative and
additive baseline-based instrumental effects respectively.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The ME thus reflects the standard Fourier transform relationship
between the uv- and image-plane, and allows for generic calibration in
both domains. Time and frequency averaging is assumed implicit in the
ME form given here. The next article in this series will consider the
individual calibration matrices in detail and their physical interpretation.

<I>Athol Kemball</I> - NRAO, Socorro<P>

<P>

A preliminary wide-field imaging capability has been added to the 
<B><I>imager</I></B> module, in addition to several enhancements of a 
general nature.  New primary beam models have been implemented which will 
be used in the mosaicing development effort. The deconvolution code has 
been re-structured; a new multi-scale CLEAN deconvolution algorithm and 
the initial implementation of maximum entropy methods have been added.

<P>

The user interface has been significantly revised, and is now based on a tool 
manager, which presents both GUI and command-line parameter-setting 
interfaces. A new record-based automatic GUI generation utility has 
been adopted. Data entry widgets for measures, files, quantities, scalars, 
ranges and records, amongst others, have been implemented in this framework. 
The new <TT>autogui</TT> capability has been used to develop an 
<TT>aipsrc</TT> GUI editor.


<P>


GUI utilities have been consolidated using a new widget server.  
<I><B>Tk</B></I>-based metawidgets have been created for dialog boxes, 
option menus, 
roll-up utilities, list boxes, check menus, and tape decks, amongst others. 
Other standard GUI utilities include a general text window, and label and 
message line utilities. This consolidation is part of the application 
integration initiative to standardize the user interface.


<P>

The <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT>  WWW home page has been revised and 
edited with continuing improvements.

<P>

Calibration development has continued with the implementation of a new 
calibration table format, and an initial cross-calibration capability. 
Work continues actively in this area.


<P>

Support for region specification in images has been added through a new 
region manager, with an associated GUI interface. 


<P>

A new <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> release plan has been checked in to 
the system as <A HREF="../../../docs/notes/222/222.html">Note 222</A>.


<P>

Work on TMS-related <FONT FACE=HELVETICA>AIPS++</FONT> utilities at NFRA has 
continued with the implementation of a new TMS dataset table and enhancements 
to the WSRT mini-package, including <TT><B>msbrick</B></TT>.


<P>

The <B><I>MSSelector</I></B> class has been rationalized, and split into 
several new classes, including <I><B>MSFlagger</B></I>, and 
<B><I>MSRange</I></B>. A new version of the <B><I>MSSummary</I></B> class 
has been checked-in, as well as a new class to list <B><I>MeasurementSet</I></B> data (<B><I>MSLister</I></B>).


<P>

Work has continued on <I>Glish</I> in support of the new <I><B>Tk</B></I> 
client (<TT>glishtk</TT>), which is now the default rather than the 
<TT>rivet</TT> implementation, and in general areas. These include the 
modification of request/reply so that other events are not blocked, 
the implementation of new sub-sequence semantics, the use of dynamically 
loaded libraries for <TT>glishtk</TT> and <TT>pgplot</TT>, a separate 
configuration script for <TT>pgplot</TT>, and the addition of new fields 
to the client records (e.g. <TT>host</TT> and <TT>pid</TT>).


<P>

Numerous changes have been made to the Parkes multi-beam code.
Some changes have been made in support of the parallelization initiative, 
including a parallel version of <TT>imager</TT> (<TT>pimager.g</TT>), the 
implementation of command logging to the user interface to allow batch 
submission of <I>Glish</I> scripts, and some changes to support MPI, 
including an option to force <I>Glish</I> socket communication if required.


<P>

The GBT <TT>MS</TT> filler has been revised and optimized. The <TT>dish</TT> 
package has also been enhanced, along with the GBT commissioning utilities. 
New data have been checked into the system for the dish demonstration.

<P>

An initial implementation of small <I>Glish</I> data types (<TT>items</TT>), 
such as <TT>regions</TT>, has been undertaken. This will allow easier 
transfer of these quantities from one tool to another.

<P>

The <I><B>Lattice</B></I> module has been revised in several general areas, 
and <I><B>Lattice</B></I>-based convolution has been added.

<P>

Sub-table names no longer contain the full main table name, to allow a direct 
UNIX <TT>mv</TT> of the table files directly.

<P>

The fitting classes have been extensively overhauled, and offer improved 
capabilities in many areas, with support for both the linear and non-linear 
cases, large problem sizes, and constraints. A new fitting capability has 
been added for two-dimensional components in <B><I>Lattices</I></B> and 
<B><I>Images</I></B>.

<P>

The new C++ <TT>for</TT> scope rules have been adopted, and the use of the 
keyword <TT>explicit</TT> has been enabled.

<P>

The explicit use of the <TT>logger</TT> in many <I>Glish</I> scripts has been 
replaced by the use of <TT>note.g</TT>.

<P>

A new compiler page has been added to the WWW page to record compiler-specific syntax requirements and propagate this information throughout the project.

<P>

The command-line parameter-setting shell <TT>app.g</TT> has been checked in, 
with related revisions to the meta-information in <TT>types.g</TT>.



<P>

An initial check-in of the Display Library classes has been completed.

<P>

The <TT>makedefs</TT> have been extended to allow linking against the I/O 
performance profiling PABLO libraries, developed by the NCSA.

<P>

A new image component fitter (<B><I>imagefitter</I></B>) has been added to the 
system. It performs 2-d component fitting in the image plane and has an 
associated GUI interface.

<P>

The Lattice Expression Language (LEL), described in 
<A HREF="../../../docs/notes/223/223.html">Note 223</A>, has been 
checked into the system. This adds the capability to perform very flexible 
operations on <B><I>Images</I></B> and <B><I>Lattices</I></B>.
