<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The Astronomical Information Processing
System, AIPS++, is now in its third public release. AIPS++ embodies
modern techniques of software development, and contains packages and
generic tools, such as the Image Viewer, that can be used for a large
range of astronomical data analysis tasks. In addition, AIPS++ has
also shown itself to be a flexible environment in which to do new
things. Examples include the Parkes multi-beam survey, the software
used to test and develop the VLBI correlator at JIVE, the very
successful work on distributed messaging at DRAO, and the GBT
observer interface. For imaging of radio synthesis data, polarization
and mosaicing are treated in a self-consistent way for the first time
using the Measurement Equation formalism. The AIPS++ team is also
developing parallel versions of some tasks. These parallel tasks will
be crucial for processing the large volumes of data from, for
example, ALMA. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The main task of AIPS++, however, is
the processing and analysis of radio astronomy synthesis data, and
this task puts the heaviest demands on the system. While the present
release supports the end-to-end processing of VLA data, it is not for
the faint hearted. Unfamiliarity with the toolkit-based design, and
robustness and performance issues for medium and large size VLA data
sets make for slow going. Some of the same issues apply to the
single-dish tools that will be used by the GBT and Arecibo.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The AIPS++ User Group suggests that the
AIPS++ team should give the following tasks their highest priority
for the next one or two development cycles: user outreach and
simplified user documentation; as well as further efforts in the
areas of debugging, and robustness and efficiency. Below, after some
general remarks about the overall project, we list in order of
priority the major issues we feel should be addressed by the team.</P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times">A Guided Tour</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is crucial that the first impression
a new user gets when starting to use AIPS++ is positive, and that the
initial interface presented to the user offers an opportunity to
explore AIPS++ before being presented with the Tool Manager. To this
end we feel that there should be a Guided Tour of the package. It may
well be that the Tour needs to have two threads: simple and advanced.
The simple thread would cover all the basic features of the package
needed to do simple tasks such as using the Image Viewer to display
images, calibrating radio astronomy data, and making synthesis images
from UV data sets. The advanced thread would introduce the tool-based
philosophy of AIPS++, the Tool Manager, Glish scripts and scripting,
and other advanced features of the package the developers want to
showcase. The Tour would use canned examples for the most part.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Times">Wizards</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The AIPS++ developers have already
introduced the concept of wizards in the package. We feel that
wizards may offer one of the best methods for new users to learn to
use AIPS++ for their own work. Whereas the Tour provides a generic
introduction to the package, a wizard acts as a personal guide to
achieve a specific goal in a straightforward way. The <FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif"><B>map</B>
</FONT>wizard, demonstrated at the User Group meeting, seems to be
the right level of sophistication and should be an example for
others. The wizards should produce a log of the session as a Glish
script that can be edited by the user and re-used. The <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">ImageTool
</FONT></B>and <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">Dish</FONT></B>
package will certainly need wizards for beginning users.</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Times">Outreach</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Now is the time to make a concerted
effort to reach the broader community to use AIPS++. In the near
term, the outreach program should emphasize hands-on workshops at
major AIPS++ sites (e.g. Socorro, Sydney, and locations in Europe).
The workshops should train small groups of new users working closely
with the AIPS++ team reducing and analyzing real data, preferably
their own. The added benefit of these workshops is that the AIPS++
developers will be able to monitor performance, debug the system, and
make it more robust. After completing the workshop, the new trainees
would return to their home institutions to train others. As the
robustness and capabilities of AIPS++ improve, visits to sites with
large numbers of potential users should be fruitful.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The AIPS++ team needs to address the
robustness and performance issues raised at the meeting. There is an
immediate need to evaluate the speed and performance of AIPS++ for
large data sets. The current release does not perform as well as
other packages in this area according to several members of the
Group.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We feel strongly that a major effort
should be placed on the development of the <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">Dish</FONT>
</B>package. This package will be highly visible to the community, as
it will be used at the GBT and Arecibo, and will, therefore, have a
potentially large impact on the acceptance of AIPS++ in general.
There should be very close collaboration between the <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">Dish</FONT></B>
developers and users at Arecibo and the GBT on the evolution of the
interface design and the development of tools. Single dish observing
has a long history, and it should be possible to draw on the
experience of the staff and users at these observatories. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It seems best to integrate <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">Dish</FONT></B>
into the overall AIPS++ package as tightly as possible. This probably
means using MeasurementSets as the basic data structure. This should
allow the use of gridding and imaging tools, for example, and provide
a unified approach to combining continuum and line data. This should
be given a very high priority.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We see no need to work on fillers for
other data formats at this time; concentrate on the GBT and Arecibo
for now.</P>

</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We feel that the Graphical User
Interfaces still need to be more intuitive. We recognize that this is
an area that is very demanding and time consuming and, therefore,
recommend that the AIPS++ developers consider hiring an outside
expert to consult on interface design. In the current release, the
most successful interfaces are the custom GUIs. The philosophy of the
tool manager, for example, is not self-evident, and the advanced
thread of the Guided Tour will need to explain the tool-based design
of AIPS++ as background to using it.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where appropriate, a tool interface
should include a message line that provides feedback to the user on
the current status of the tool, or prompts the user about what to do
next, perhaps based on the current context.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We recognize that a tremendous effort
has gone into documenting AIPS++. In conjunction with the Guided Tour
and Wizards, we feel that the documentation should include a
directory of example Glish scripts for common tasks. It seems clear
to us that repetitive processing will usually be done with scripts,
and example scripts that the user can easily modify will yield
results more quickly. We suggest that the AIPS++ group invite the
more experienced users to help document the system with the goal of
producing a simple step-by-step cookbook for the most obvious
reduction tasks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The proposal to put all documentation
in PDF format will considerably simplify preparation, and we
recommend that this take place as soon as possible.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We regard the current <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">ImageTool</FONT></B>
as a very good start, with many good features. This tool has clearly
benefited from the custom GUI approach. Providing a message line with
status information or prompts to the user should be added as soon as
feasible. High priority should be given to increase capabilities to
visualize and analyze 3-D data sets, including, fitting spectral
features in 3 dimensions, allowing slices to be made, and profile
averaging. There should be a way to export fit parameters to a text
file. It would also be very useful to be able to export animations. A
simple way to reset the graphics seems warranted as well.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As mentioned above, a wizard for the
<B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">ImageTool</FONT></B> would be a
great benefit. The wizard can show all the basic functions of the
buttons, as well as simple analysis tasks and contour plotting.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Future development directions could
include tools to analyze Zeeman splitting as well as a fitter for
Galaxy rotation curves.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We strongly support the concept of
vertically integrated (wizard) tools like <B><FONT FACE="Helvetica, sans-serif">map</FONT></B>,
and feel that the idea can be extended to other areas of the AIPS++
package. These types of tools will quickly introduce new users to the
functionality of AIPS++, and allow them to do some real work with low
overhead.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the near term, we feel that support
for combining single-dish and interferometer data should be part of
the next phase of development, and effort should continue in support
of VLBI processing. Future work should include the ability to
transfer phase information from one wavelength to another, which will
be needed for the transition to mm-wave work.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We feel that the current level of
effort for parallelization within AIPS++ is about right, and we will
be following developments in this area closely. Other areas that
would probably benefit from parallelization are fringe fitting and
the simulator.</P>

</OL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Glish has proved itself to be very
useful and easy to learn, and much of the day-to-day processing in
AIPS++ will very likely be done via Glish scripts. We see no need at
this time for major enhancements such as true object orientation, or
the addition of a debugger. It seems a bit late to invest too much
time in publicizing Glish to a wider audience, although it would be
useful if it could be distributed as a separate product. The Glish -
tk binding is extremely useful and should be maintained until
something better/faster comes along. Upgrading the transport layer to
CORBA seems reasonable, but should be transparent to current users,
and should not break existing code.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally, a high priority should be
given to bringing the user manual up to date so that it reflects the
current state of the code and covers all its features.</P>
