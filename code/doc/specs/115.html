<H2><A NAME="intro">1. Introduction</A></H2>    
<P> AIPS++ is an acronym for the <STRONG>Astronomical Information
Processing System</STRONG> that is being designed and implemented by a
consortium of seven radio astronomy institutions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF),</LI>
<LI>the Herzberg Institute for Astrophysics (HIA) through the Dominion
Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO),</LI>
<LI>the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO),</LI>
<LI>the Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy (NFRA),</LI>
<LI>the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratory (NRAL),</LI>
<LI>the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) through the
National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) with GMRT headquarters at
Pune, and</LI>
<LI>the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA).</LI>
</UL>
<P>AIPS++ is intended to replace the <A HREF="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/"
>AIPS</A> (Astronomical Image Processing System) with a more modern,
more extensive, and more extensible software system.</P>  
<P>  This document is mainly based upon the User Specification 
<A HREF="#references"
>documents</A> prepared by each member  of the consortium, with some use
of other written contributions to the User Specifications Memo series.  
"Distillation documents'', written by the consortium members
participating in the initial six months design phase in Charlottesville,
have been extensively used in the preparation of this document.</P> 
<HR><!--NewPage--> 
<H2><A NAME="general">2. General Characteristics of AIPS++</A></H2> 
<H3><A NAME="principles">2.1. Guiding principles</A></H3> 
<P>These specifications describe the capabilities needed in AIPS++ by
astronomers who use telescopes operated by members of the consortium. 
We attempt to avoid expressing opinions on how such capabilities should
be implemented.  However, because AIPS++ should be optimized for the
astronomer user, we do specify some aspects of the user interface that
we consider essential.</P>  
<P>AIPS++ must anticipate a wide range of experience within its user
community.  Both the user interface and the off-line documentation must
address the disparate needs of novice (or occasional) users and of
experienced users who may be analyzing technically demanding
observations.  To match the needs of users with a wide range of
experience, a hierarchy of interfaces and documentation will be
essential.  Users will also need a hierarchy of programmability.  At the
lowest level of experience, this should allow them to connect major (and
sometimes repetitive) steps in data processing conveniently.  At the
highest level, an efficient interface is needed to encourage development
of new, experimental, algorithms and processing techniques.</P>  
<P>   The following principles are important in the design and
implementation of AIPS++:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Accountability</STRONG> -- Data should have associated
telescope performance ("monitor") and processing histories so their
origins and evolution can be easily reviewed and understood by
astronomers.  Unnecessary structures should not be imposed on data, and
data should be accessible in both "raw'' and any modified forms.
However, it should be possible to have very flexible selection of data
sub-sets.
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Astronomical terminology and concepts</STRONG> -- Names
and labels in the data processing system should use the common language
of astronomy and mathematics. 
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Programmability</STRONG> -- It should be easy for users to
prepare data processing "scripts'' for repetitive or multi-stage
processing, and to augment the system easily with new operations and
algorithms.  
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Easy Customization</STRONG> -- The user should be able to
flexibly select data processing packages to be used, the style of user
interface, and environmental parameters such as directory names and
output devices. 
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Hiding complexity</STRONG> -- Where possible the
complexity of algorithms or  multi-step processing should be hidden from
the novice user.  
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Confidence in results</STRONG> -- Data processing
diagnostics and the capability to un-do and re-do steps in the
processing are essential for telescope data so the user can understand
and have confidence in the data at any processing stage.  
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Range of processing styles</STRONG> -- the same software
should be usable for both post-observing processing and remote or local
on-line data analysis
</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Future types of processing</STRONG> -- the design should
allow for future growth in network computing with use of remote
displays, remote batch processing, and parallel processing of different
machines or in machines with parallel processing architecture.
</LI> 
</UL><H3><A NAME="goals">2.2. Scientific goals</A></H3> 
<P>AIPS has been an acronym for "Astronomical Image Processing System";
 however, its capabilities, and users' requirements, have evolved far
beyond image plane processing.  AIPS++ should now be a general tool for
turning telescope data, and model calculations, into scientific results.
In some cases, e.g.,  graphics and tables, the results should be in
publishable form. Most n-dimensional images are produced only as an 
intermediate step between raw data and useful results, however some
constitute final scientific results and require reproduction in
publishable form.  A similar range of purposes has evolved for single
dish data in systems such as 
<A HREF="http://info.gb.nrao.edu/unipops/unipops-home.html"
>UniPOPS</A>.  The concept for AIPS++ should be that of an 
<STRONG>Astronomical
Information Processing System</STRONG>.</P><P>In specifying a new
software system, it is useful to consider what aspects of astronomical
data processing have remained stable over the last 15 or so years.  The
most stable parts of array and single-dish processing systems are the
<EM> fundamental</EM> descriptions of telescope data.  For the major
arrays, the basic description has accumulated more attributes (e.g. 
spectral channels, IFs) but it is still fundamentally a visibility data
set -- samples of a spatial coherence function in some convenient
spatial or temporal order.  Similarly, a final image is still an array
of calibrated pixel intensities in a known coordinate system,
polarization, and  observing frequency.  The "end results'' are
scientifically meaningful quantities extracted from one or more such
images, and published visual representations of these images.   Key, and
probably stable, basic ingredients of a user specification are therefore
the types of <EM> data</EM> to be handled (e.g.  visibility data,
single dish spectra, images, image cubes).</P><P>Basic operations on
parts of data sets, such as Fourier transforms, least squares fitting
algorithms, plotting, display, mathematical, and other standard
functions are also relatively stable.  We will call these basic
operations <EM> tools</EM>.  The second ingredient needed by users is
an itemized tool kit of basic operations from which more complex
astronomical applications can be assembled.</P>  
<P>In contrast, the algorithms used to calibrate, construct and
interpret data sets and images evolve as the astronomical community
acquires experience and sophistication in data and image analysis
techniques.   The algorithms are the least stable elements of present
software.  They continually evolve or are replaced (either as explicit
programs or as informal procedures that may involve astronomer
interaction).  The algorithms are embodied in <EM>tasks</EM> which can
be implemented either as specific programs in a language such as C++ or
as scripts in a higher level language.  Many of the tasks that are now
part of the lexicon of astronomical image processing will be embodied in
AIPS++ at an early stage.  The tools in the kit provided by AIPS++ must,
however, be easily usable by astronomers to carry out new tasks whose
nature and scope may evolve rapidly with time.</P> 
<P>In these terms, the core of AIPS++ must provide a generic toolbox
operating on specific data types.  Given the finite resources available,
the limitations of AIPS++ should be more in the diversity of data that
can be handled rather than in what can be done to these data.</P>  
<H3><A NAME="attributes">2.3. General attributes of AIPS++</A></H3>  
<P>AIPS++ should have good command line interface with "full''
programming capability.   This should be at the level to eliminate, for
most astronomers, the need to write FORTRAN or C++ programs.  We view
the issue of who will be able to develop applications programs as one of
the most important issues for the future. "Full programming"
capabilities with the AIPS++ "command language" is very important;
however, the use of C++ and FORTRAN "template" programs that can be run
"with" AIPS++ is also important.  In addition, the current plan to have
many astronomers doing C++/OOP programming for AIPS++ will require
special attention to astronomer-oriented documentation, programming
guides, and possibly things like programming "summer schools".  Assuming
that everyone can learn what they need from industry-wide material aimed
at professional programmers is unwise, and is likely to limit the AIPS++
pool of developers to too small a group with too little astronomical
experience.</P> 
<P>Documentation for AIPS++ should be available both on-line and in
hard copy. This should have multiple levels ranging from simple "help"
to extensive information, and dealing with both specific applications
and individual parameters..  Consistency between hard copy and on-line
documentation is imperative.  Multi-window environments, as mentioned
above, should allow context-sensitive information to be displayed by
"clicking" on appropriate items.  While the implementation aspects of a
UNIX "man" page might be useful, the displayed information should be
easily understandable to user-astronomers.</P> 
<P>Multiple levels of user interface would be desirable to allow for
both novice users and experienced expert.  User selection of the style
of interaction and the range of "packages" to be used should be
possible.  Choice of the user interface should have no effect on the
code used in processing.</P> 
<P>Styles of user interface are difficult to decide upon, and are very 
dependent upon user experience and preference.  The discussion in
<A HREF="#wood1991">Wood (1991)</A> is an example of a useful approach
to the user interface that goes into details we have not discussed here.
We recommend planning a number of available styles, and extensive user
testing of each of them during early phases of AIPS++ development, as
opposed to deciding upon one approach and precluding all others.  The
idea that the user interface is just another applications task, that can
take many forms, is probably very important in planning for the future
with a wide range of user needs and expertise.</P> 
<P>A combination of the inclusion of single dish data reduction as part
of the domain of AIPS++, and the increased use of "nearly real-time"
data processing and remote observing for both single dish observing and
arrays, makes the use of AIPS++ as an integral part of the observing
process very important.  This should not change or add to  the
processing and display needs of AIPS++, but rather adds to the richness
of the tools  that can be used to support the users' involvement in the
observing process. In addition the post-processing tools need by
instrumental staff to maintain their instruments have great commonalty
with the things a knowledgeable astronomer would like to see and do
during the observing process.  The observer would like:</P>
<UL>
<LI>capability to see instrumental status data both at the telescope
and on remote display devices connected to the telescope by networks;
</LI>
<LI>automatic first order data editing and calibration where possible;
</LI>
<LI>as much immediate data processing and display as feasible in
real-time;
</LI>
<LI>to be able to make changes in the observing program during
observing "runs"; and
</LI>
<LI>to be able record data processed in "nearly real-time" on
transportable media for further processing
</LI> 
</UL><P>In addition to the use of normal AIPS++ processing tasks, this 
list of needs makes it necessary for preparation and changing of
observing programs to be immediately possible.  Indeed, the preparation
of observing programs may become one of the extended tasks of AIPS++ for
some instruments.</P> 
<P>The simulation of data produced by real instruments, based upon
assumed models of sources, is an additional capability that is essential
for AIPS++.  This should be viewed as a necessary part of the testing of
AIPS++ applications software (both for de-bugging and evaluating
efficiency of processing), and as a tool for the astronomer that
provides both more realistic preparation for observing and the necessary
tools to compare models and data in AIPS++.</P>
<HR><!--NewPage-->   
<H2><A NAME="data">3. Data</A></H2> 
<H3><A NAME="nature">3.1. The general nature of the data for AIPS++</A></H3>

<P>The data will come principally from radio telescopes although AIPS++
must allow import of images and data from other wavelengths.   The
primary data types that are needed to support the AT, BIMA, EVN, GMRT,
MERLIN, VLA,  VLBA, WSRT,  the future mmA, and the various instrument
packages on the JCMT, GBT, the 12m and the 43m are as follows:</P> 
<OL>
<LI>Telescope status information
</LI>
<LI>Total power and phased array data sequences reflecting switched or
time series observations
</LI>
<LI>Spectra
</LI>
<LI>Images   <OL>
 
<LI>Planar images at radio, optical, X-ray, etc. wavelengths   </LI>
<LI>Spectral cubes - images in multi-spectral regions   </LI>
<LI>Time cubes - time-ordered images of variable sources   </LI>
</OL></LI>
<LI>Coherence function (visibility) data from correlation arrays   <OL>
 
<LI>arrays with real-time delay and phase variation correction   </LI>
<LI>tape recording arrays where the correlator output is coherence     
   function data for a range of time lags (or transformed  frequencies) 
 </LI>
</OL></LI>
<LI>Calibration tables
</LI>
<LI>Data editing information
</LI>
<LI>Computed models 
</LI>
<LI>Processing histories
</LI> 
</OL>
<P>Some of these data categories are naturally associated with
each other; it is also important to be able to group some together when
appropriate, e.g. in mosaicing observations.  Some of these data types
are either super-sets or sub-sets of others; it is important to be able
to compose super-sets out of sub-sets and to decompose super-sets into
their sub-sets.</P> 
<P>It is important that the astronomer have access at all stages of
data processing to the conditions under which an observation was made,
and to what has been done to it in the data processing.  The ability to
wipe the slate clean has proven its utility over and over again in many
data processing systems.  Hence the database should carry both
telescope-provided status information and a processing history in 
formats that make it easy to "start over" if processing goes awry.  This
supplementary information begins with data structures with telescope
information as a function of time, position, or other data identifiers
such as telescope name, latitude, etc.   It continues with data
processing history sufficient to understand, un-do, and re-do that
processing.</P>  
<P>Another view of the data relates to different uses and time scales
of use.  These uses lead to three major categories of software:  on-line
data analysis; system support software for staff operating and
diagnosing the operation of the instrument; and observers analysis
software.  For single telescopes the observer has often done a major
fraction of data analysis at the telescope as part of observing process.
 Recent hardware and networking developments have made such on-line data
analysis feasible even for high data rate instruments like the large
arrays and single dishes with fast sampling spectral processors.  Most
telescopes have, or soon will have, full remote and local analysis
capability. In all these system data should be accessible to the user as
soon as practicable in nearly real-time. For all these reasons data
analysis software in the AIPS++ system should  provide for the needs of
the above mentioned three categories of software.</P> 
<P>   Different single dishs and arrays have different approaches to
data handling in which similar words mean different things.  These
"cultural" difference in language must be directly addressed and data
descriptions and terminologies that are consistent at all telescope and
development sites must be created and maintained.</P> 
 
<H3><A NAME="organization">3.2. User-oriented data organization</A></H3>

<P>From the point of view of the user the highest level identification
of the problem is what we will call a "project".  Projects are aimed at
obtaining answers to scientific questions.  Answers to these scientific
questions frequently involve obtaining data from a variety of
telescopes.  Some projects require radio data from both single dish and
array observations from the same or different instruments, each serving
a different "purpose". Observations for each instrument are organized
into observing "runs" with sequences of "scans" with identical
instrumental and observing parameters.  Each scan contains "sub-scans"
with data elements in the form of spectra, time instances of coherence
function data or spectra, etc., that are associated with instances of
time.  Astronomers need to deal with this hierarchy of data: project,
purpose, instrument, observing run, scans, and sub-scans.  It would be
very helpful if the astronomer could be aided  in dealing with things
according to this hierarchy.  Data that are viewed as simple sequences
of data from stand-alone telescopes leave the astronomer to impose a
mental image of project/instrument/purposes and then runs/scans on the
simple data elements.   The future mmA will be a case where the same
instrument will generate both single dish and coherence function data
sets.  This makes it a prime example where the same instrument will
serve diverse instrumental purposes for a wide variety of "projects".</P>

<P>In this document we list preparation for observing as an AIPS++
task. This is partly because simulation, using AIPS++ processing tools,
can be very useful in understanding an observing program during the
planning and preparation process.  In addition, it is at this stage that
the user imposes the logic of project/instrument/purposes/runs/scans on
the observing process, and this logic must be remembered and used as
part of the data reduction and processing.  If tools were available in
AIPS++ to aid the user in passing on and using this logic all the way
through data processing, it would be very helpful.  It would be
analogous to having and updating the map of a maze that can be used
while passing through the maze.  Data processing is very much like a
maze to be negotiated for most astronomers, and assistance in dealing
with the higher level purposes of data would be very useful.</P> 
<P>The above can be describe more technically by saying that data sets
should have a hierarchy of descriptor (or "header") items, with
descriptor items being identified by context information (such as name,
position, etc., for images). These data descriptors should allow
specification ranging very large, merged data sets to basic elements
like pixels or u-v data points.  It should be possible to eliminate
redundancy by describing information on a sufficiently high level while
allowing exceptions by overriding this information at a lower level;
that is, mixtures of positive and negative data/information 
specifications.</P>

<H2><A NAME="requirements">4. Specific Requirements</A></H2> 
<P>This section contains long lists of brief description of the
elements of the user requirements from all the consortium
specifications.  It is based on a merger of the distillation of
specifications by  AIPS++ working groups in the areas of "User
Interfaces",  "UV Data System and Processing Requirements", and "Image
Handling" -- and the original <A HREF="#references">material</A> from
individual consortium user requirements.</P> 
<H3><A NAME="interfaces">4.1. User interfaces</A></H3> 
<H4><A NAME="411">4.1.1. General</A></H4>
<UL>

<LI>Users should be able to execute operating system command sequences
from any interface
</LI>
<LI>Application "task" parameters should have the following properties:
  <UL>
<LI>All parameters should have assigned defaults, possibly dependent on
context
</LI>
<LI>Selected parameters should be user-assigned according to the mode
of user interface

<LI>Parameters should NOT be global across applications, unless
specifically requested or used to specify processing environment and
scope</LI>
<LI>Names must be consistent across applications, using astronomical
terminology where possible</LI>
<LI>Parameters should be able to be passed between applications when
applications share the same parameters</LI>
<LI>Checking of parameters by applications before execution starts 
should be done whenever possible (the user will be warned about
inconsistent, unusual, or dangerous combinations, and, for the latter, 
may refuse executions with re-entry dependent on the type of user
interface)</LI>

</LI>
<LI>Planned developments in the use of parallel processing make it very

</LI>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="412">4.1.2. Command line interface</A></H4>

<LI>As much as possible, applications written for the AIPS++
interpreter should look the same (to users) as those written in the
compiled language</LI>
<LI>A very useful feature would be "un-do" operations wherever this is
feasible</LI> 
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="413">4.1.3. Graphical user interface</A></H4> 
<P>The basic graphical interface should be the primary user interface 
for users in 1994. It should be the most attractive one for most AIPS++
users, and maybe even for experts.  It should be a window-oriented
graphical interface with pull-down menus (for application selection and
parameter specification), multiple windows, and pop-up menus for context
sensitive help.  Menus for application selection and parameter
specification should have pop-up sub-menus with options/parameters
depending on menu context.</P> 
<P>It would be desirable if there were an advanced GUI with visual
programming of applications.  Icons/glyphs for individual "tool" 
components and connecting lines for passing of data.  Sequence of
graphical task and data flow connections should be capable of being
saved, edited, and retrieved.</P>  
 
<H4><A NAME="414">4.1.4. User documentation</A></H4> 
<P>Documentation for AIPS++ must be a planned part of the AIPS++
development.  It should be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Uniform in style, which may require a central documentation editor
or a single, capable technical writer;
</LI>
<LI>Prepared by, or in real consultation with, experts on the material;
</LI>
<LI>Use astronomical and mathematical terminology wherever possible;
</LI>
<LI>Not be the same as programming documentation except for the case of
AIPS++ programming guides or cook-books aimed at astronomers;
</LI>
<LI>Be completely available on line, based on the same textual material

<LI>Antenna characteristics can be very different across the array,  
hence one must be careful about antenna-based simplifying assumptions   
 </LI>
</UL></LI>

determined for each antenna, and determination of these quantities are

<LI>For spectral line sources one can do amplitude calibration with

</LI>
<LI>Accurate Doppler correction for each spectral channel is essential

is essential, with the limitations that sources must be detected in a
few minutes and only bright sources can be observed unless one does
phase-referencing

<LI>For polarization calibration, all calibration sources are resolved
and the polarized intensity distribution may not be like he total
intensity distribution, therefore one must iteratively determine both
source polarization structure and instrumental polarization

for feed polarization, which is non-linear and computationally
"expensive", because one must calibrate mixed linear and circular
polarization characteristics (requires very careful amplitude and phase
calibration)

de-convolution "tools", for example, using CLEAN to deconvolve in the

<H3><A NAME="analysis">4.6. Image analysis</A></H3> 
<P>Many of the major functions of image analysis have already been 
discussed under the general category of data structure transformations
and analysis.  This is an area of applications that is highly dependent
upon astronomer specification of the needs for a particular problem. For
this reason tools for this analysis, and programmability by the
astronomer, are most important.  A few cases that illustrate advanced
problems are the following.</P> 
<P>The extraction of information from data cubes is one of the most
important, but computationally (and visually) difficult areas of image
analysis.  The visualization problem in general requires both special
hardware and flexible analysis software.  The relation of most data
cubes to spectroscopy, and the importance of radiative transfer to
spectroscopy, presents a basic need for the astronomer to analyze data
in an environment where it is possible to compute and compare models
derived from spectral radiative transfer.  Since this cannot be viewed a
the job of any instrumental support group, the versatile programming of
computational tools is the most important thing for the astronomer who
has reached this stage of "image analysis".</P> 
<P>In addition to spectroscopy, image analysis and comparison, for some
problems in the future will require dynamical gas/fluid computations.
For example, analyzing HI or molecular line images of galaxies as
snapshots of "fluids" means the divergence, curl, and Laplacian of
vector fields must be calculated to study continuity, vorticity, and
viscosity.</P> 
<P>Moving source problems, particularly the difficult case of solar
imaging, requires special modeling or data corrections. Rotation and
registration of imaging taken at different times and locations, and with
different instruments, requires special treatments dependent upon the
scientific problem at hand, which is usually in the solar system domain
involving the Sun, planets, asteroids, comets, etc.</P>  
<H3><A NAME="display">4.7. Data display and recording</A></H3> 
<P>By data display we mean listings, plots, and "pictures" that are
useful in examining data and results derived from data.  By recording we
mean hard copy of these data displays.  The form of data display depends
on the user interface.  The form of data recording may depend upon
printer and other hardware so output files should be as
device-independent as possible, with separate production of
device-dependent files.</P>

<H2><A NAME="conclusions">5. Conclusions</A></H2> 

<P>The preparation of specifications for AIPS++ involves two major
complications.</P> 

<P>The first is that the instruments, and the types of measurements for
which they are designed, are diverse and complicated at levels of detail
that are important for many applications.  However, this can be handled
by careful attention to detail and a judicious balance between
generality and those details.  In this document we have dealt mainly
with generalities, so technical details needed in the implementation of
software for specific instrumentation must be dealt with elsewhere.</P> 

<P>The second, and most severe problem, is that while it may be
(relatively) easy to specify what we need for the science of the past
and present, the most important needs are for the scientific problems of
instruments and astronomers in the future.  Careful consideration of
what this means for a software system leads to one general conclusion:
availability of computational tools, user-programmability of these
tools, and easy transferability of data between software systems are the
most important capabilities that one can have for the future of any
scientific software system.</P>
