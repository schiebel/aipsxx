Currently there are eleven operations pre-defined within Dish. These operations
are general utilities available from the basic Dish Gui. All operations
have two basic buttons: a green Apply button which will execute the given
operation and a yellow Dismiss button which will close the operation frame
but retain all information in that frame for subsequent use.

\subsubsection{Averaging}

The Averaging operation offers several options for performing the averaging 
(Figure~\ref{fig:aversel}). Alignment which may be either None, By Velocity,
or By X-Axis, 2) Rest Frequency, which allows shifting to match the first
in the average (for example, for averaging spectra from transients), 3)
Weighting which may be None, Tsys and Time or by RMS, and 4) which will
use any selections chosen from the Selection Operation prior to averaging.

the Averaging and Selection Operation frames open.}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Baselines}

\begin{figure}
\begin{flushleft}
  \plotfiddle{dishbaseline.ps}{1.25in}{0}{85}{85}{-160}{-0}
  \caption{\label{fig:baseline}Example window showing basic Dish frame with 
the Baseline Operation frame open. In this example, one baseline region is 
selected and a 5th order polynomial will be shown overlayed on top of the 
spectrum.}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

The Baseline operation allows either a polynomial fit or a sinusoid fit.
The baseline regions may be typed into the regions entry box at the bottom
of the frame, or selected via cursor (the Plot Ranges and Cursor Active
buttons should both be checked). The baseline operation frame can be
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:baseline}.

The default action is to calculate the baseline and show it. Once the fit
seems satisfactory, the 'Subtract' button must be checked and the fit
'Apply'd. This will remove the baseline and display the resultant
spectrum. The baseline fit may be viewed from the results manager.
The current ranges selected will be displayed in the entry field. A history
of these is preserved within a cache which can be viewed by clicking on 
the down-arrow button. The RMS of the fit is displayed to the right of
the frame. Units for ranges or fit parameters (sinusoid only) may be
converted between channels and X-Axis units using the Convert button.

\subsubsection{Calculator}

The Calculator operation is a general tool for manipulating spectra in ways
not facilitated by the basic set of operations. Spectra may be transferred
into the calculator stack through the use of the Copy/Paste to Clipboard
facility.

\begin{figure}
\begin{flushleft}
  \plotfiddle{calculator.ps}{6.25in}{0}{85}{85}{-260}{-100}
  \caption{\label{fig:calculator}Example window showing basic Dish frame 
with the Calculator Operation frame open}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

The Copy/Paste facility is activated by the right mouse button. A popup
menu appears with a two copy options and a paste option. 
``Copy to clibpoard'' will copy whatever is
selected in the Calculator stack listbox to the Clipboard; the 
Clipboard is simply a
convenient virtual storage area. ``Copy to results manager'' copy whatever
is selected in the Calculator stack listbox to the results manager.
``Paste from clipboard'' retrieves whatever was most recently
sent to the clipboard. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:calculator}, the
Results Manager spectrum ``average3'' was copied into the Calculator stack. 
An ``\_1'' designation was
added to the label to distinguish it from the same value in the Results Manager.
The spectrum
was then multiplied by a factor, producing ``average3\_1\_2''. The additional
id tag is an underscore and the stack number.

The available functions may be seen in the figure. In addition, it works
as any standard Reverse Polish Notation calculator. Numbers, vectors and
arrays may be typed into the entry field. The calculator will only work
with SDRECORDs, numbers, vectors and arrays.

\subsubsection{Function on Data}

The Function on Data operation is another means of manipulating the displayed
data. The string typed in the entry box of this operation is evaluated by
glish after any of the standard macros are replaced by their equivalent
glish.  The result of this evaluation is then reassigned to the data
array of the last viewed SDRECORD.  The standard macros and their
meanings are:
\begin{description}
\item[DATA] sdrecname.data, the data record of sdrecname.
\item[DESC] sdrecname.data.desc, the data description record of sdrecname.
\item[ARR] sdrecname.data.arr, the data array.
\item[HEADER] sdrecname.header, the header record.
\item[NS\_HEADER] sdrecname.ns\_header, the ns\_header record.
\end{description}
In the above definitions, sdrecname is whatever the name of the last
viewed data set.  For these macro substitutions to work, they must
be given as upper case (to distinguish them from their lower case
equivalents, in which no substitution would occur).

Since whatever this text evaluates to after macro substituion is
reassigned to the data array, it must have the exact same shape
as the data array initial had.

Basic scaling or manipulations can be obtained by typing expressions
that operate on ARR. For example, a simple scaling can be obtained by 
typing the function ``ARR*1.5'', and then pressing ``Apply''. 
Any function available from
within \glish\ or known at the command line (e.g. a function defined by the
user during the run of Dish), can be accessed and used in these expressions.

\subsubsection{G Fit}

The Gaussian Fitting operation is not contained under the main operation
menu. Instead, it is available directly from the plotter. Pushing the ``G Fit''
button calls up the interface window. The number of gaussians to fit is
set by the ``No. components'' slider and entry field. The number can either be
typed in or the slider can be adjusted to the number of gaussians desired. 
This number will be reflected in the number of component buttons created
below. Depressing a component button makes it active, allowing setting
of its properties.

Depressing the green ``Estimate'' button generates an auto-estimate of a 
component, generating an approximate flux, pos, and width (height, center,
width for the gaussian). Depressing the green ``Fit profile'' button will
generate a fit based on that guess. Interactive estimates for each component
can be obtained by pressing the component button followed by the ``Inter''
button (below the ``Estimates'' title). This prompts the user to:
``Put cursor at line center and click (any)'' and then ``Put cursor at
line HWHM and click (any)''. This fills the flux, pos and width fields
with the appropriate guess. Continue with the next component and then hit
``Fit profile'' when all have been defined.

The Plot menu at the top of the frame allows the user to specify which 
aspects of the fit to view: Estimate, Fit, Residuals. Each of these may be
toggled on-off interactively.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Re-gridding}

The Re-gridding operation is a more generalized version of the Smoothing 
Operation as it allows both finer and coarser adjustments of the grids.
Currently, it allows Hanning, Boxcar and Gaussian smoothing along with
Spline and Fourier Transform Interpolations.

\begin{figure}
\begin{flushleft}
   \plotfiddle{regrid.ps}{5.5in}{0}{85}{85}{-250}{-150}
  \caption{\label{fig:regrid.ps}Example window showing basic Dish frame with 
the Regrid Operation frame open}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Saving}

The Saving operation allows the user to store and organize spectra into
named working sets. The working set must first be defined through the
File Menu option ``Open'' (selecting on Read and Write). Once the working
set is defined, any displayed spectrum may be written to the working
set on disk.

\subsubsection{Selection}

The Selection operation allows a number of selection criteria to be chosen
to create new working sets which are subsets of existing working sets. The
available entry fields are: Object Name, Record, Scan, Date, LST, and Rest Frequency.
Typing into any of these fields is allowed but the selection will only be
used if the check box on the right is marked. A history of selected ranges
or names will be preserved. For numerical selections, ranges may be made
as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Record,Scan Entry:
8,9,10				# Select scans 8, 9 and 10
8,[10:13],17			# Select scans 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 17
\end{verbatim}

For Object Name selection you can type in a single name by typing any
characters except quotes (single or double) and square brackets.  That
name will be used in the selection.  The ``*'' can be used as a
wildcard.  For multiple source names you can either enclose the 
source names with double quotes or you can use
the glish bracket syntax to indicate a vector of source names.
The following examples illustrate these differences:

\begin{verbatim}
This is one long source name   # a single source name
"This is five source names"    # turned into five strings by glish
['This','is','five','source','names'] # same as previous example
['This','is three','source names'] # three sources
\end{verbatim}

The ``All'' button will display all relevant values for the given entry
field in a separate pop-up window.

\subsubsection{Smoothing}

The Smoothing operation is a more specific tool than the Re-gridding operation.
It offers easy Hanning, Boxcar and Gaussian smoothing.

\begin{figure}
\begin{flushleft}
  \plotfiddle{smoothing.ps}{5.5in}{0}{85}{85}{-250}{-160}
  \caption{\label{fig:smoothing}Example window showing basic Dish frame with 
the Smoothing Operation frame open}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Statistics}

The Statistics operation calculates basic statistics on an interval of
the spectrum. The interval must be defined by the cursor (activate
the Plot Range and Cursor Active buttons) and then left click on the
left and right regions of the spectrum which are of interest. The
region will appear in the Range entry field and the Start and Stop
fields will be populated by the beginning and end of the range;
NOTE: currently, only the first range in the rangebox will be used
for the calculation of statistics. If you want changes to the start and
stop range for your interval, those changes should be edited or entered
at the start/stop entries. 
The units may be converted
between X-Axis units and channels through the convert button (similar
to the Baseline operation capability). The Apply button will calculate
the Peak value, the location of the peak, the Area over the region,
the location of the centroid (half area), the rms, and the minimum.
These values may be written as a record to the clipboard through the
``Copy to CB'' button. The record looks as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
- statrec:=dcb.paste()
- statrec
[peak=2.09596825, area=29425582.1, min=-0.26479581, rms=0.580018938, scan=20, ce
ntroid=2.22369707e+10, vpeak=2.22353317e+10] 
-
\end{verbatim}

In addition, the data may be written to a file through the ``Print to File''
button. This pulls up a frame which prompts the user for a filename. If
the file exists, it will append the values to the end of the file. The
file looks as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  scan  start          stop           atPeak         Centroid 
    20  2.2225160e+10  2.2245390e+10  2.2235332e+10  2.2236971e+10 
        Peak           Area           Mininum        rms 
        2.0959682e+00  2.9425582e+07 -2.6479581e-01  5.8001894e-01 
\end{verbatim}

with the interval Statistics Operation frame open}
\end{flushleft}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Write to File}

This operation allows convenient output to a disk file in the current directory.
It automatically defaults to the file name of ``scan\_number.spc''; for example
if you Write to File while looking at scan 20, the file will be ``20.spc''.
The file looks as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
     FREQ              other axis 
       Hz              other unit 
22203023360.000000    -3.907563
