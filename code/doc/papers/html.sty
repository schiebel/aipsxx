% LaTeX2HTML Version 95.1 : html.sty
%
% This file contains definitions of LaTeX commands which are
% processed in a special way by the translator. 
% For example, there are commands for embedding external hypertext links,
% for cross-references between documents or for including
% raw HTML.
% This file includes the comments.sty file v2.0 by Victor Eijkhout
% In most cases these commands do nothing when processed by LaTeX.

%%% LINKS TO EXTERNAL DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to provide links to arbitrary documents.
% The first argumment should be the text that is going to be
% highlighted and the second argument a URL.
% The hyperlink will appear as a hyperlink in the HTML 
% document and as a footnote in the dvi or ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallinkfoot}[2]{#1\footnote{#2}} 

% This is an alternative definition of the command above which
% will ignore the URL in the dvi or ps files.
\newcommand{\htmladdnormallink}[2]{#1}

% This command takes as argument a URL pointing to an image.
% The image will be embedded in the HTML document but will
% be ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\htmladdimg}[1]{}

%%% CROSS-REFERENCES BETWEEN (LOCAL OR REMOTE) DOCUMENTS
%
% This can be used to refer to symbolic labels in other Latex 
% documents that have already been processed by the translator.
% The arguments should be:
% #1 : the URL to the directory containing the external document
% #2 : the path to the labels.pl file of the external document.
% If the external document lives on a remote machine then labels.pl 
% must be copied on the local machine.
%
%e.g. \externallabels{http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/WWW/doc/tex2html/latex2html}
%                    {/usr/cblelca/nikos/tmp/labels.pl}
% The arguments are ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externallabels}[2]{}

% This complements the \externallabels command above. The argument
% should be a label defined in another latex document and will be
% ignored in the dvi and ps files.
%
\newcommand{\externalref}[1]{}

%%% HYPERREF 
% Suggested by Eric M. Carol <eric@ca.utoronto.utcc.enfm>
% Similar to \ref but accepts conditional text. 
% The first argument is HTML text which will become ``hyperized''
% (underlined).
% The second and third arguments are text which will appear only in the paper
% version (DVI file), enclosing the fourth argument which is a reference to a label.
%
%e.g. \hyperref{using the tracer}{using the tracer (see Section}{)}{trace}
% where there is a corresponding \label{trace}
%
\newcommand{\hyperref}[4]{#2\ref{#4}#3}

%%% HTMLREF
% Reference in HTML version only.
% Mix between \htmladdnormallink and \hyperref.
% First arg is text for in both versions, second is label for use in HTML
% version.
\newcommand{\htmlref}[2]{#1}

%%% HTMLIMAGE
% This command can be used inside any environment that is converted
% into an inlined image (eg a "figure" environment) in order to change
% the way the image will be translated. The argument of \htmlimage
% is really a string of options separated by commas ie 
% [scale=<scale factor>],[external],[thumbnail=<reduction factor>
% The scale option allows control over the size of the final image.
% The ``external'' option will cause the image not to be inlined 
% (images are inlined by default). External images will be accessible
% via a hypertext link. 
% The ``thumbnail'' option will cause a small inlined image to be 
% placed in the caption. The size of the thumbnail depends on the
% reduction factor. The use of the ``thumbnail'' option implies
% the ``external'' option.
%
% Example:
% \htmlimage{scale=1.5,external,thumbnail=0.2}
% will cause a small thumbnail image 1/5th of the original size to be
% placed in the final document, pointing to an external image 1.5
% times bigger than the original.
% 
\newcommand{\htmlimage}[1]{}

%%% HTMLADDTONAVIGATION
% This command appends its argument to the buttons in the navigation
% panel. It is ignored by LaTeX.
%
% Example:
% \htmladdtonavigation{\htmladdnormallink
%              {\htmladdimg{http://server/path/to/gif}}
%              {http://server/path}}
\newcommand{\htmladdtonavigation}[1]{}
