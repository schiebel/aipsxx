A programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&amp;T
Bell Labs <I>ca.</I> 1972 for systems programming on the PDP-11 and
immediately used to rewrite <A HREF="u.html#Unix">Unix</A>.
It was called "C" because many features derived from an earlier
compiler named "B" in commemoration of its parent, BCPL.  Before Bjarne
Stroustrup developed <A HREF="#C++">C++</A>, there was a humorous
debate over whether C's successor should be named "D", or "P" (following
B and C in "BCPL").</P>
<P>C is terse, low-level and permissive. Partly due to its distribution with 
<A HREF="u.html#Unix">Unix</A>, C became widely used outside Bell Labs
after 1980 and has grown popular due to its simplicity,
efficiency, and flexibility.  C is sometimes described, with a mixture
of fondness and disdain, as "a language that combines all the elegance
and power of assembly language with all the readability and
maintainability of assembly language".</P>

<P>The original C, known as "K&amp;R C" after B. W. Kernighan and
D. R. Ritchie's book [<CITE>The C Programming Language</CITE>, Prentice-Hall (1978, 1988)], has been standardized (and simultaneously modified) as ANSI C

<P>In radio interferometer imaging, gridding convolution is

denote the grid spacing.  That is, it is equivalent to the use of a

product of two <VAR>sinc(x)</VAR> functions; this function does not
decay rapidly enough to yield very effective

arithmetic operations at each iteration, and typically there may be
hundreds or thousands of iterations. The Clark algorithm proceeds by
operating not on the full residual image, but rather by picking out only
the largest residual points, iterating on these for a while (during its
"minor cycles" or inner iterations) and only occasionally (at the "major
cycles") computing the full <VAR>n</VAR>&#215;<VAR>n</VAR> residual
image, by means of the

major cycle, it again picks out the largest residuals and goes into more
minor cycles. And, for further economy, during these inner iterations
the dirty beam is assumed to be identically zero outside of a relatively
small box (termed the beam patch) which is centered about the origin.

It is better to use these secondary colors when mixing pigments, as

Although black could be obtained by mixing CMY in equal proportions, in four-color
printing it always has its own ink; hence the CMYK
model.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="convolution_theorem">convolution theorem</A></STRONG></DT>

<DD>

<P>This theorem is well-known, but seldom is quoted in its
distributional form:  for two distributions, <VAR>f</VAR> and <VAR>g</VAR>,
the Fourier transform of the convolution of <VAR>f</VAR> and <VAR>g</VAR>
is given by</P>

<P><IMG SRC="convthrm.gif" ALIGN="TOP"></P>
<P>whenever one distribution is of compact <A HREF="s.html#support">support</A>
and the other is a <EM>tempered</EM> distribution. (Loosely speaking, a
tempered distribution is one which does not increase too rapidly at
infinity.) See Y.Choquet-Bruhat, C.Dewitt-Morette, and
M.Dillard-Bleick, <CITE> Analysis, Manifolds, and Physics</CITE>, North-Holland, New York,
1977, ch. VI.</P>
<P>One ought to be aware of this form of the theorem, since often one
must deal with convolution of functions that are not of compact
support---
<A HREF="d.html#dirty_beam"><EM>dirty beams</EM></A>, 
<A HREF="p.html#principal_solution"><EM>principal solutions</EM></A>, 
<A HREF="i.html#invisible_distribution"><EM>invisible distributions</EM></A>,
etc.--- whose Fourier transforms do not exist as ordinary functions, but
only as distributions or generalized functions.
</P>
<P>
Convolution of distributions, itself, is defined, in general,
whenever the support of either distribution is compact, or (in one
dimension) when the supports of both distributions are limited on the
same side. For distributions which are absolutely integrable ordinary
functions, and whose Fourier transforms possess the same property, the
compact support assumption is not required here, or above. Related fact:
convolution is not always associative (i.e., <VAR>f*(g*h)</VAR> is not
equal to<VAR>(f*g)*h)</VAR>, in general), but it is associative
provided that all the distributions, with the possible exception of one,
are of compact support. See the above-cited reference.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="coprocessor">coprocessor</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
Any computer processor which assists the main processor by
performing  special tasks faster than they can be executed by software
running in the main processor. A coprocessor often decodes instructions
in parallel with the main processor and executes only those intended for
it. The most common example is a 
<A HREF="f.html#floating-point">floating-point</A> coprocessor,  others
are used for graphics and for networking.

</DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="correlator_offset">correlator offset</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>A basic assumption of much interferometer calibration software
(e.g., the <A HREF="s.html#self-calibration">self-calibration</A>
algorithm) is that the systematic errors in the visibility measurements
are multiplicative errors that are ascribable to individual array
elements and their associated <A HREF="l.html#local_oscillator">i.f./l.o.</A> chains, and that---at a given
instant---each such antenna-based error has an identical effect on each
visibility observation involving that antenna/i.f. combination.
Systematic measurement errors which do not conform to this model are
called <EM>correlator offsets</EM> or <EM>non-closing errors</EM>. See
<A HREF="a.html#antenna/i.f._gain"><EM>antenna/i.f. gain</EM></A>.
</P>
<P>
Correlator offsets can be the limiting factor in obtaining high
dynamic range images from radio interferometers. Some observers have
reported fairly large multiplicative correlator offsets which vary
slowly with time and which do not appear to vary with the 
<A HREF="p.html#phase_tracking_center">phase tracking center</A> or
with source structure. From observations of an external calibrator, one
may estimate, and compensate for, such offsets.
