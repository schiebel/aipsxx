<DD>

<P>The classical Paley-Wiener theorem says that a square-integrable
complex-valued function <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="fhat.gif">, defined
over the real line, can be extended off the real line as an entire
function of <A HREF="e.html#exponential_type">exponential type</A>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="leq.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM
SRC="twopi.gif"><VAR>a</VAR> if and only if its Fourier transform f(x)
is identically zero for |<VAR>x</VAR>|&gt;<VAR>a</VAR>, --- i.e., if
and only if <VAR>f</VAR> is <EM>band-limited</EM> to
[<VAR>-a,a</VAR>].  (For a derivation, see H. Dym and H. P. McKean,
<CITE>Fourier Series and Integrals</CITE>, Academic Press, 1972.)
</P>

<P> The <A HREF="s.html#Shannon_sampling_theorem">Shannon series</A>
is a means of extending <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="fhat.gif"> to the
entire complex plane <STRONG>C</STRONG>.  The extension of the
Paley-Wiener theorem to the case of generalized functions (to tempered
distributions) is called the <EM>Paley-Wiener-Schwartz</EM>
theorem.</P>

<P>The Fourier transform <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="fhat.gif"> of a
function <VAR>f</VAR> with support in a given <VAR>n</VAR>-dimensional
convex compact set <VAR>K</VAR> can be analytically extended to all of
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="cplanen.gif">.  Growth properties on <IMG
ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="fhat.gif"> which are sufficient in order for the
converse to hold are given by K. T. Smith, D. C. Solomon, and
S. L. Wagner <CITE>Practical and mathematical aspects of the problem
of reconstructing objects from radiographs</CITE>,
Bull. Amer. Math. Soc., <STRONG>83</STRONG> (1977) 1227-1270: in
addition to the classical version of the multi-dimensional
Paley-Wiener theorem, for rectangular <VAR>K</VAR>, they give versions
with tighter growth bounds, and for arbitrary convex <VAR>K</VAR>.
Smith <i>et al.</i> use the Paley-Wiener theorems to establish
indeterminacy theorems for tomographic reconstruction.  Their results
are also relevant to Fourier synthesis, because of the connection
between the two-dimensional Fourier transform and the one-dimensional
Radon transform.  The Paley-Wiener theorems have also been used in
establishing results on the problem of <A
HREF="#phaseless_reconstruction">phaseless reconstruction</A> and in
proving the convergence of constrained <EM>Gerchberg-Saxton</EM>-type
deconvolution algorithms (see A. Lent and H. Tuy, <CITE>An iterative

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="panel">panel</A></STRONG></DT>

<DD>

<P> A segment of the reflecting surface of an antenna that is
independently formed with its supporting rib structure, and is mounted
on the <EM>backup structure</EM> as a unit.  </P>

<P>Panels are mounted to the backup structure on screws so that their
relative positions can be optimized.  This allows the <A
HREF="a.html#antenna_gain">antenna gain</A> and <A
HREF="e.html#effective_area">effective area</A> to be maximized when
an antenna is commissioned.  It also allows the panels to be realigned
later, either to compensate for changes in the antenna structure or to
refine the initial adjustment using improved surveying techniques
(such as <A HREF="h.html#holography">holography</A>).  </P>

<P>In advanced antenna designs, the panels are mounted on calibrated
<EM>actuators</EM>, so that their alignment may be adjusted
continually under remote control.  This permits active correction for
modeled, or measured, deformations of the reflecting surface during an
astronomical observation.  In the <A HREF="g.html#GBT">GBT</A>, such
an <EM>active surface</EM> will be used to maximize the <A
HREF="a.html#antenna_gain">antenna gain</A> and minimize <A
HREF="#pointing_error">pointing errors</A>, especially at the higher
observing frequencies.</P>

<P>In older antennas, the reflecting surface itself was often
manufactured independently of the supporting ribs.  In this case the
segments of that surface alone may be called <EM>plates</EM>; the term
<EM>panel</EM> then applies to the combination of a plate and the
segment of rib structure to which it was joined before being mounted

also describes the orientation of a fixed direction on a telescope,
such as the direction of sensitivity of a linearly-polarized receptor
on an antenna, relative to celestial co-ordinates.  If an antenna is
on an equatorial mount, the parallactic angle of any receptor will not
change relative to any celestial object that it is tracking (unless
the receptor is deliberately rotated during the observation).  If an

Wall.  Perl is an interpreted language optimized for scanning
arbitrary text files, extracting information from those files, and
printing reports based on that information.  According to its author,
the language was intended to be easy to use, efficient, and complete,
rather than elegant.  It embodies powerful operations such as regular
expression substitution, and an expression syntax that corresponds
quite closely to that in <A HREF="c.html#C">C</A>. It also supports
dynamically scoped variables and functions, nested data structures and
exception handling.  Although optimized for scanning text, Perl can
also deal with binary data.</P>

<DD>

<P>1. A set of formal rules describing how to transmit data among computers,
especially across a network.  <EM>Low level</EM> protocols define the
electrical and physical standards to be observed, bit- and
byte-ordering and the transmission, error detection and
correction of the bit stream.  <EM>High level</EM> protocols deal with
the data formatting, including the syntax of messages, the
terminal to computer dialog, character sets, sequencing of
messages etc.

<P>A stub that is used to manipulate the real object which is

to the server, retrieves the results, then presents them to the user
of the proxy object. This technique is particularly valuable as it
allows <A HREF="c.html#command_line_interpreter">CLI</A> users to
manipulate objects created in another language, such as C++.  </P>

CLEAN</A></STRONG></DT>

<DD>

<P>A modified version of the <A HREF="h.html#Hogbom_CLEAN">H&ouml;gbom
CLEAN</A> algorithm, devised by Tim Cornwell.  The idea is to drive
the CLEAN algorithm toward an approximate solution <VAR>f</VAR> of
minimal Euclidean norm---i.e., to find an <VAR>f</VAR> consistent with
the data, confined to the <A HREF="c.html#CLEAN_window">CLEAN
window</A>, comprised of a small number of point components, and such
that

SRC="delta.gif">-function of amplitude <VAR>w</VAR>, centered at the
origin, to the <A HREF="d.html#dirty_beam">dirty beam</A>, and then
proceeding as normal with the CLEAN algorithm.  Proper choice of
<VAR>w</VAR> depends on the distribution of measurement errors. See
