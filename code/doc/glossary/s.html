<DD>

<P>Many of the systematic errors affecting interferometer visibility
measurements may be assumed to be multiplicative and ascribable to
individual array elements. That is, in an <VAR>n</VAR> element array,
the observations on the <VAR>n(n-1)/2</VAR> baselines are afflicted by
<VAR>n</VAR> sources of error, the so-called <A
HREF="a.html#antenna/i.f._gain">antenna/i.f. gains</A>
<VAR>g</VAR><IMG ALT ="_k" ALIGN=MIDDLE
SRC="tiny_k.gif"><VAR>(t)</VAR>.  Given a rough estimate of the true
source visibility, a model obtained, say, by mapping and cleaning
roughly calibrated data, one may solve for the unknown gains-and it is
not unreasonable to do so, because there are <VAR>(n-1)/2</VAR> times
more observations than antenna gains. he number of degrees of freedom
can be held further in check by assuming that the <VAR>g</VAR><IMG ALT
="_k" ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_k.gif"><VAR>(t)</VAR> are slowly-varying
or that they are of unit modulus (i.e., that no amplitude errors are
present), or by designing an array with redundant spacings.</P>

<P>Having once solved for the unknown <VAR>g</VAR><IMG ALT ="_k"
ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_k.gif">, one may correct the data, make another
image, and repeat the process.  This iterative scheme, which yields
successive approximations to the true radio source brightness
distribution, is known as <em>self-calibration</em>.  Self-calibration
is essentially identical to the technique of <A
HREF="h.html#hybrid_mapping">hybrid mapping</A>, which is widely used
in <A HREF="v.html#VLBI">VLBI</A>.  See <em><A

SRC="v_ijtild.gif"> is the visibility measurement obtained on the
<VAR>i-j</VAR> baseline (at a given instant), <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM
SRC="v_ij.gif"> is the corresponding <em>model</em> visibility, and
the <VAR>w</VAR> are suitably chosen weights.  Usually the
<VAR>g</VAR><IMG ALT ="_k" ALIGN=MIDDLE

with time <VAR>t</VAR>, so that one may minimize, instead, the

<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="obsvbyv.gif"></P> 
<P>is the time-average of the
ratio of observed visibility to model visibility, over a time
period during which the gains may be assumed constant.</P>

<P>It has been common (e.g., in Classic <A
HREF="a.html#AIPS">AIPS</A>) to allow the choices <VAR>p = 1</VAR> and
<VAR>p =2</VAR> when solving for the gains.  Choosing <VAR>p = 2</VAR>
yields the least-squares solution for <VAR>g</VAR>.  When one chooses
<VAR>p = 1</VAR>, so that a weighted sum of the moduli of the
residuals is minimized, the computed gain solutions are less
influenced by wild data points, but there is some loss of statistical
efficiency---i.e., the least-squares solutions are superior when the
distribution of measurement errors is well-behaved. Setting
<VAR>p</VAR> near 1.2 might offer a better compromise between
efficiency and robustness.  See VLA Scientific Memo. No. 136
[F. R. Schwab, <CITE>Robust solution for antenna gains</CITE>] for
further details.</P>

<P>One may wish to solve only for the <EM>antenna/i.f. phases</EM>
<IMG ALIGN-BOTTOM SRC="psik.gif"> rather than for the full <IMG

<P>Cornwell and Wilkinson
[<CITE>A new method for making maps with unstable radio interferometers</CITE>,
, <STRONG>196</STRONG> 1981) 1067-1086]
suggest adding to <STRONG>S</STRONG> terms which arise by assuming prior
distributions for the <VAR>g</VAR><IMG ALT ="_k" ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_k.gif"><VAR>(t)</VAR>;
these "penalty terms" would be chosen so as to increase in magnitude
as the solution parameter deviates from a prior mean
which one might take, say, as the running mean of previous gain solutions.
The widths of the prior distributions could be based on empirical
knowledge of the behavior of the array elements.
Such a modification can be useful when the
array is composed of antenna elements of differing

<A NAME="Shannon_sampling_theorem">Shannon sampling theorem</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
Suppose the complex-valued function <VAR>f</VAR> of the real variable <VAR>t</VAR> to be
square-integrable, and assume that <VAR>f</VAR> is band-limited; i.e., that its
Fourier transform</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="ft_t_2_x.gif"><P> is zero for |<VAR>x</VAR>|&gt;<VAR>a</VAR>.
Then <VAR>f</VAR> is completely determined by its values at the discrete
set of sampling points <VAR>n/2a</VAR>, 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="nseries.gif">, and <VAR>f</VAR> can be
recovered via the <em>Shannon series</em> (also called the <EM>cardinal series</EM>):</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="shannons.gif"></P>
<P>The series converges both uniformly and in the mean-square sense.

<P>The Shannon series can be derived by expanding <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM
SRC="fhat.gif"> in a Fourier series, and then applying Fourier
inversion---or it can be derived from the classical Poisson summation
formula.  It is sometimes referred to as <EM>Whittaker's cardinal
interpolation formula</EM> or the <EM>Whittaker-Shannon sampling
series</EM>, having first been studied in detail by E. T. Whittaker in
1915 and later introduced into the literature of communications
engineering by Shannon in 1949.  By the <A
HREF="p.html#Paley-Wiener_theorem">Paley-Wiener theorem</A>, since
<VAR>f</VAR> is band-limited, it can be analytically extended from the
real line to the full complex plane, as an entire function of slow
growth.  The Shannon series, which converges for complex as well as
real <VAR>t</VAR>, is one means of doing so.  Whittaker referred to
the series as "a function of royal blood in the family of entire
functions, whose distinguished properties separate it from its
bourgeois brethren."</P> 

<P>Suppose that <VAR>f(t)</VAR> is "small" for
|<VAR>t</VAR>|&gt;<VAR>b</VAR> (no nontrivial signal is both
band-limited and time-limited).  Then, assuming that <VAR>b</VAR> is
integral, the number of terms in the Shannon series that really matter
is <VAR>4ab</VAR>.  This suggests that the space of "essentially
band-limited" and "essentially time-limited" signals has dimension
equal to the time-bandwidth product <VAR>4ab</VAR>.  The precise sense
in which this is so, together with a discussion of the <A
HREF="p.html#prolate_spheroidal_wave_function">prolate spheroidal wave
functions</A>, which are relevant to the problem, is described by
H. Dym and H. P. McKean [<CITE>Fourier Series and Integrals</CITE>,

comments on Fourier analysis, uncertainty and modeling</CITE>, SIAM
Rev., <STRONG>25</STRONG> (1983) 379-393].</P>

<P>The extension of the sampling theorem to 2-D rectangular sampling
implies that if an "unconfused" radio source <VAR>f(x,y)</VAR> is
confined to a small region of sky <VAR>x</VAR> &lt; <VAR>X</VAR>,
<VAR>y</VAR> &lt; <VAR>Y</VAR> (radians), then it can be reconstructed

wavelengths.  See <A HREF="c.html#cell_size">cell size</A> and <A

sampling lattices), to the case of stochastically jittered sampling,
to derivative sampling (e.g., in 1-D, <VAR>f</VAR> can be recovered
from samples of <VAR>f</VAR> and its derivatives through order
<VAR>r</VAR> taken at intervals <VAR>(r+1)(n/2a)</VAR>, etc.---and

type are of compact <A HREF="#support">support</A>--are

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="spatial_resolution">spatial resolution</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>In digital image analysis, this term refers rather imprecisely to
the minimum size of details which can be discerned.  The spatial
resolution is determined by three factors: the inherent indeterminacy
of whatever <A HREF="i.html#image_reconstruction">image
reconstruction</A> problem underlies the method by which the image was
produced (and the properties of the image reconstruction <A
HREF="a.html#algorithm">algorithm</A> which produced the image); the
measurement noise; and the <A HREF="p.html#pixel">pixel</A> size, in
this case taken to mean the size of the squares or the rectangles
comprising the reconstruction matrix.</P>

<P>In radio astronomy, the inherent spatial resolution goes roughly in
inverse proportion to the physical extent <VAR>D</VAR> of the antenna
(in single-dish observing) or of the array (in interferometry),
measured in wavelengths.  For observations at a wavelength <IMG
ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="lambda.gif">, the inherent spatial resolution
obtained with a filled aperture is essentially <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM
SRC="lambda.gif"><VAR>/D</VAR> radians.</P>

<P>With an <A HREF="a.html#aperture_synthesis">aperture synthesis</A>
array with large gaps in the <A
HREF="u.html#u-v_coverage"><VAR>u-v</VAR> coverage</A>, the effective
resolution is somewhat coarser than <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM
SRC="lambda.gif"><VAR>/D</VAR> with <VAR>D</VAR> set by the maximum
baseline length, however.  Often, some measure of the spread of the
central lobe of the <A HREF="d.html#dirty_beam">dirty beam</A> (say,
the <A HREF="f.html#FWHM">FWHM</A>) is quoted as the spatial
resolution.  However, some <A HREF="i.html#image_reconstruction">image
reconstruction</A> methods (e.g., the <A
HREF="r.html#regularization_method">regularization methods</A>)
produce images in which the resolution of bright features may be much
finer than that of dim features.  This property of regularization
methods may be viewed as either good or bad: signal-to-noise dependent
spatial resolution complicates the interpretation of an image, but, on
the other hand, one may gain additional contrast resolution---i.e.,
low surface-brightness features may become more readily discernible.
An honest statement concerning the spatial resolution of an image must
be based upon empirical knowledge of the reconstruction method that
was used.  See <A HREF="#super-resolution">super-resolution</A>.  </P>
