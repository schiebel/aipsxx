<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="background_noise">background noise</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>In astronomy, a term applied to all sources of unwanted
fluctuations in the output of a system that is producing, measuring or
recording a signal.  Natural background noise sources in radio astronomy
include galactic noise  (synchrotron radiation), thermal noise from
receivers and the Earth's atmosphere, quantum noise, and the cosmic
microwave background.  Some of these are, of course, in the <EM>foreground</EM>
of most astronomical objects!
</P>
</DD>
  
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bandpass_calibration">bandpass calibration</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>In radio astronomical spectroscopy, the calibration of the
amplitude and phase response of a system across the entire set of
spectral channels within which data have been recorded.</P></DD>  
 
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bandwidth_smearing">bandwidth smearing</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>

<P>In an image from a radio interferometer, space-variance of the
point spread function which is attributable to non-monochromaticity,
or finite bandwidth. The point spread function---at a particular point
in a map--- taking into account bandwidth smearing, but ignoring other
instrumental effects, is termed a <EM>delay beam</EM>. Bandwidth
smearing is a radial effect: the delay beams become more elongated in
the radial direction from the interferometer <A
HREF="p.html#phase_tracking_center">phase tracking center</A> as their
distance from the phase tracking center increases. The delay beams are
easily calculable when all of the receivers in an array have
identical, and known, i.f. passbands.</P> <P>Bandwidth smearing can,
in principle, be eliminated (assuming that the bandpass shapes are
known) by applying an <A HREF="i.html#image_reconstruction"><EM>image
reconstruction</EM></A>
 algorithm which knows about the smearing mechanism; that is, by an
algorithm which is more general than the usual <A HREF="d.html#deconvolution"
>deconvolution</A> algorithms. The most common method for reducing
bandwidth smearing is the technique of 
<A HREF="#bandwidth_synthesis"><EM>bandwidth synthesis</EM></A>.</P>

</DD> 
 
 
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bandwidth_synthesis">bandwidth synthesis</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
A technique of radio interferometry which is intended to
diminish the effect of <A HREF="#bandwidth_smearing"><EM>bandwidth
smearing</EM></A>. Bandwidth synthesis observing is very similar to
spectral-line mode observing: the i.f. bandpasses are split up into a
number of pieces, or
<EM>channels</EM>, and the data in each channel are treated separately
up until the imaging/deconvolution stage of processing. At that stage,
the problem can be formulated as a system of simultaneous convolution
equations. See also <A HREF="#broadband_imaging"><EM>broadband imaging</EM></A>.
</P>
</DD>   

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="base_class">base class</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>

</P>
</DD>  

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="baseline">baseline</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
1. In radio interferometry, the separation between the
electrical, or phase centers of two interferometer elements.
See also <A HREF="#baseline_co-ordinates"><EM>baseline co-ordinates</EM></A>, <A HREF="u.html#u-v-w_co-ordinates"><VAR>u-v-w</VAR> <EM>co-ordinates</EM></A>.
</P>
<P>
2. In spectroscopy, the contribution to a spectrum from phenomena
that are not of astronomical interest, such as frequency dependent
properties of the receivers,  unwanted multi-path propagation in an
antenna structure, or spectral lines emitted by the Earth's atmosphere,
or by astronomical sources other than those under study.
</P>
</DD>  

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="baseline_co-ordinates">baseline co-ordinates</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>In radio astronomy, the <A HREF="#baseline">baseline</A> co-ordinates of an interferometer 
are often given as <VAR>b</VAR><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_x.gif">, <VAR>b</VAR><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_y.gif">, <VAR>b</VAR><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="tiny_z.gif"> in an equatorial Cartesian co-ordinate system whose axes point as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>X to <A HREF="h.html#hour_angle">hour angle</A> 0 hrs, <A HREF="d.html#declination">declination</A> 0&#176;, (i.e. to the direction
of the <A HREF="m.html#meridian">meridian</A> at the <A HREF="c.html#celestial_equator">celestial equator</A>)</LI>
<LI>Y to hour angle -6 hrs, declination 0&#176; (i.e. to the east), and</LI>
<LI>Z to declination 90&#176;, (i.e. to the <EM>north celestial pole</EM>).</LI>
</UL>
<P>The above equatorial baseline co-oordinates are related to the azimuthal 
(conventional surveyor's) description of the baseline in terms of 
components to the north, to the east and in elevation (vertical) by:</P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="azimbase.gif"></P>

<DD>
<P>
A set of <A HREF="v.html#visibility_function">visibility</A>
measurements 
<VAR>V</VAR> is said to be in baseline-time order if the ordering is
such that all of the data for the 1-2 baseline, sorted by time, occur
first, followed by the data for the 1-3 baseline, again sorted by time,
etc. This ordering is convenient for purposes of data display.
</P>
</DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="baud">baud</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
The maximum information-carrying capacity of a communication
channel in symbols (state-transitions or level-transitions) per second. 
This coincides with bits per second only for two-level modulation with
no framing or stop bits.  A symbol is a unique state of the
communication channel, distinguishable by the receiver from all other
possible states.  For example, it may be one of two voltage levels on a
wire for a direct digital connection or it might be the phase or
frequency of a carrier.</P>
<P>Where data are transmitted as packets, the actual "data rate" of a
channel is
<VAR>R * D / P</VAR> where <VAR>R</VAR> is the "raw" rate in bits per
second (including packet overhead), <VAR>D</VAR> is the number of data
bits in a packet and <VAR>P</VAR> is the total number of bits in a
packet.
</P>
<P>The term "baud" was originally a unit of telegraph signalling speed,
set at one Morse code dot per second.  It was proposed at the
International Telegraph Conference of 1927, and named after J.M.E.Baudot
(1845-1903), the French engineer who constructed the first successful
teleprinter.</P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="beam">beam</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
1. In radio interferometry, the inverse Fourier transform of
the <A HREF="u.html#u-v_sampling_distribution"><VAR>u-v</VAR><EM>
sampling distribution</EM></A>, or of a 
<A HREF="u.html#uniform_weighting"><EM>weighted</EM></A> <VAR>u-v</VAR>
sampling distribution, possibly convolved with a 
<A HREF="g.html#gridding_convolution_function"
><EM>gridding convolution function</EM></A>: the idealized response to
a point, or unresolved, radio source.
</P>
<P>2. A numerical approximation to 1.</P>
<P>3. A digitized version of 2, sampled on a regular grid (usually
regarded as an image).</P>
<P>4. Synonymous with 
<A HREF="p.html#point_spread_function"><EM>point spread function</EM></A>.</P>
<P>5. (Occasionally) as above, but taking into account instrumental
effects, so that the beam depends on position in the sky. See <A HREF="d.html#dirty_image"
><EM>dirty image</EM></A>.</P>
<P>Occasionally, any one of the above, other than 5, is termed the
<EM>synthesized beam</EM>.</P>
</DD>  
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="beam_patch">beam patch</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>In the <A HREF="c.html#Clark_CLEAN">Clark CLEAN</A> 
algorithm, that portion of the central part of the beam which is used in
the inner iterations, or the minor cycles, of the deconvolution.</P></DD>
 
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="beam_squint">beam squint</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>In radio interferometry, direction dependent, or space-variant
<A HREF="i.html#instrumental_polarization">instrumental polarization</A>,
which is difficult to calibrate, can arise from beam squint. The beam
squint effect, for the usual case of a pair of (nominally) orthogonally
polarized feeds on each array element, is due to differences in their
power patterns: in particular, to differences in the directions of their
peak response.</P></DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="beam_switching">beam switching</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>In single dish radio astronomy, any technique which forms  the
difference of signals received from two (or more) pointings on the sky
without physically moving the main reflector of the antenna. Beam
switching may be achieved by:</P>
<UL>
<LI>using multi-feed receivers with either hardware (waveguide) or 
software-based switching systems,
</LI>
<LI>nutating (or wobbling) part of the antenna's secondary optics,
often its subreflector, or</LI>
<LI>using a quasi-optical chopper, at millimeter wavelengths.</LI>
</UL>
<P>By rapidly forming differences between sky positions that do and do
not contain astronomical sources, beam switching can minimize  the
corruption of spectral baselines by non-idealities in the instrumental
frequency response, or of continuum observations by atmospheric
fluctuations.
</P>
</DD>
 


<DT><STRONG><A NAME="Binding">Binding</A></STRONG></DT>
    <DD>
      <P>
	The connection of a software component to another, usually 
          a <a href="u.html#user_interface">user interface</a>, so that a <a
	  href="u.html#user">user</a> may make use of it. In

	interface.

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bit">bit</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>Contraction of "binary digit": the smallest amount of
information that can be stored in digital memory, either 0 (off) or 1
(on).</P></DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bitmap">bitmap</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>A data file or structure which corresponds bit for bit with an
image displayed on a computer display, usually in the same format as it
would be stored in the display's video memory.  A bitmap is
characterized by the width and height of the image it represents.  A
bitmap may also represent a colored image, in which case more than one
bit  will be used to represent each <A HREF="p.html#pixel">pixel</A>. 
Computer graphics that treat <A HREF="i.html#image">images</A> as 
collections of dots rather than as shapes, or objects, may be described
as <EM>bitmapped graphics</EM> or <A HREF="r.html#raster_graphics"><EM>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="blanked_pixel">blanked pixel</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>In a digital <A HREF="i.html#image">image</A>,  a <A HREF="p.html#pixel"
>pixel</A> whose value is undefined. In computer storage of quantized
digital images, some special numeric value is assigned to the blanked
pixels, so that they may be recognized as undefined and given whatever
special treatment is required.</P></DD>   
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="blinking">blinking</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>In astronomical image processing, a method for comparing two
similar but different images wherein a display is switched between the
two images in rapid succession.  Spatial  differences appear to move
back and forth, while intensity differences pulsate.  When  the
switching rate, duty cycle and transfer functions of the displays are
controllable by the user, blinking is a powerful tool for assessing
subtle but systematic differences between  images, e.g. those due to
moving or variable objects in crowded fields, or to subtle artifacts in
image formation. 
</P>
</DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="brightness_temperature">brightness temperature</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>A measure of the intensity of a region of the sky, based on the
temperature of a black body that would emit radiation of the  observed
intensity at the given observing frequency.  Frequently computed in
radio astronomy using the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, in which case it
is directly proportional to the intensity per unit area.  For thermal
emission mechanisms, it may correspond to a physical temperature in an
emitting region.</P></DD>   
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="broadband_imaging">broadband imaging</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>A refinement of the radio interferometric method of
<A HREF="#bandwidth_synthesis">bandwidth synthesis</A>, in which one
solves simultaneously for the radio brightness distribution <VAR>f(x,y)</VAR>
 at some reference frequency, and for the (spatially varying) spectral
index across the observing band.  Assuming that the observing band is
split into <VAR>n</VAR> frequency channels centered at</P>
<P><IMG SRC="nu1ton.gif" ALIGN="TOP"></P>
<P>one solves the simultaneous set of convolution equations</P>

<P>where in the <VAR>k</VAR>'th frequency channel <VAR>g</VAR> is the
dirty image, <VAR>b</VAR> the dirty beam and <VAR>f</VAR> is given by:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="bbandimg.gif" ALIGN="TOP"></P>
<P>The <VAR>b</VAR> are identical apart from a dilation factor.  If
the frequency channels are narrow enough, one can expand the <VAR>u-v</VAR>
coverage considerably with immunity to <A HREF="#bandwidth_smearing">bandwidth
smearing</A>. Fractional bandwidths as great as 20% to 30% can be used,
depending on the linearity of the spectral index variations.</P></DD> 
  
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="browser">browser</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>A program designed to render <A HREF="h.html#hypertext">hypertext</A>
documents, possibly with multimedia extensions such as graphics, sound

node to another. Browsers act in a

remote computers as servers.</P></DD> 

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="bug">bug</A></STRONG></DT>
<DD><P>An actual or a perceived programming error or program
deficiency. The bug may be in the eye of the beholder since a user  may
fancy an application similar to, but differing from, the one for which
the program is intended.  When real, may be fixed by a <A HREF="k.html#kluge"
