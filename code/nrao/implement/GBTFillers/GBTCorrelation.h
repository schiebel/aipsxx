// </reviewed>

// <prerequisite>
//   <li> The POLARIZATION table of the MeasurementSet.
//   <li> The SPECTRAL_WINDOW table.
//   <li> The DATA_DESCRIPTION table.
//   <li> The GBT FITS files.
//   <li> The GBT filler.
// </prerequisite>
//
// <etymology>
// This holds information that describes the correlation type 
// appropriate for one row of a MS.  This is used for GBT data
// and within the GBT filler.  This information includes the
// data description id and the two components of the data description
// table (spectral window id and polarization id).  It also 
// includes information necessary to fill the polarization table.
// Finally, it keeps a record of which sampler row contributed to
// each pair of receptors in a given correlation.
// </etymology>
//
// <motivation>
// When this information was being held by a larger class, it was getting
// confused with other issues related to that class.  By putting it in a
// smaller, simpler class the maintenance will be easier and usage will
// be less confusing.
