//   <li> GBTIFFiller
//   <li> GBTLO1DAPFiller
//   <li> Contents of the GBT IF and LO FITS files
// </prerequisite>
//
// <etymology>
// The GBT fillers need to take the IF and LO fits files plus their receiver
// tables and other information to arrive at feeds, spectral windows, and
// polarizations as well as groupings of data so that they can be filled into
// the MS appropriately.
// </etymology>
//
// <synopsis>
// Currently, this is only useful for SpectralProcessor data.  It needs to be
// generalized as much as possible.
// </synopsis>
//
// <example>
// </example>
//
// <motivation>
// The code in the SP filler that this is derived from was getting sufficiently
// large and confusing that it was difficult to see the forest for the trees.
// Moving it here served to encapsulate it all in one place, hopefully making
// it easier to modify, understand, and reuse.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="yyyy/mm/dd">
//   <li> This needs to work for the other backends as well.
