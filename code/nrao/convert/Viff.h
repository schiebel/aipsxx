// .LIB(aips)

// This class encapsulates the Khoros "Viff" format. It will normally be
// used to interconvert AIPS++ in-memory arrayss and Viff disk files. The
// primary limitation of the Viff format is that it can only deal with up-to
// 3-dimensional arrays. If an array of greater than 3-dimensions is put into
// a Viff structure an error is returned (first, however an attempt is made
// to remove degenerate (length==1) axes).

// All Viff types are handled, and conversions will occur automatically.
// The conversions use the normal C++ assignments, e.g. converting from floats
// to bytes is not apt to be very meaningful (maybe we should put in automatic
// scalings?).

// TBF - At the moment the user array types are only floats, although any underlying
// Viff format is supported, except for the complex types.

#include <casa/aips.h>

// These should be forward declared; how do you do that with templates?

    // will cause a "False" to be returned, since Viff images are restricted
    // to 3 dimensions. When the Viff type and the Array types differ,

    // initialized it will return a 0-sized array and set the flag to False.

    // will overwrite an existing file.
    Bool write(String name);

    // Viff can be thought of as always containing a "3D" data structure, and
    // a vector is when only one of the dimentions is non-unity. nx(), ny() and

    // i.e. we can assign nx()*ny() N-dimensional locations. Fundamentally
    // this is done by giving a Cube<float> of values where the first two
    // indices in the Cube correspond to the (x,y) in the Viff structure, and
    // the Z-depth of the cube corresponds to the dimensionality of the
    // positions we want to assign.
    // Because a Cube can be constructed from a Vector, to create a file which
    // contains a y vs x vector plot, you merely have to do something like:
