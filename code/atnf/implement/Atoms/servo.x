/*
 * Intended Use:
 * ============
 *
 * This interface is designed to present an idealised antenna servo
 * system. It is intended that it will cope with both the Compact Array
 * style of antenna servo system, and the Parkes antenna servo system
 * in normal operational uses, plus others in the future. It is not
 * intended to present an interface that can be used for general
 * maintenance functions on these antennas, as these functions are
 * often highly antenna specific, and usually not of much interest to
 * the observing system anyway.
 *
 * The antenna model that this interface uses is of a drive system with
 * two axes that can be driven to any position in a specified range.
 * This pair of axes and an arbitrary number of other pairs of axes
 * have encoders that can read the current absolute position of each
 * axis.
 *
 * Nomenclature:
 * ============
 *
 * Procedure names and const names are prefixed by "SERVO_RPC__".
 * Other symbol names that exist as global symbols in the program
 * module are prefixed by "servoRPC_". Procedure names and other
 * symbols are often referred to in the documentation without these
 * prefixes (eg, reference to the TRACK_SHORT procedure really means
 * the SERVO_RPC__TRACK_SHORT procedure).
 *
 * All angles are specified in radians. All times are expressed as
 * either absolute of relative BAT. All velicities are in radians per
 * second.
 *
 * Request and Readout Coordinate Systems:
 * ======================================
 *
 * The servo system can be controlled in only one coordinate system (the
 * request coordinate system), but can supply readouts in more than one
 * coordinate system (the readout coordinate systems) simultaneously.
 *
 * All coordinates that pass through the interface are dial settings,
 * that is are allowed the full range of the servo axes. In some cases
 * this may be greater than 360 degrees. Wrap issues are handled by
 * higher levels of software.
 *
 * Coordinates that pass through the interface are not corrected for the
 * antenna pointing model (ie, the servo implementation corrects
 * coordinates that it gets from the interface for the pointing model
 * before applying them to the axes, and does the reverse for readout
 * coordinates before passing them out through the interface). This means
 * that the entire angular range of each axis is presented in the
 * interface.
 *
 * It is usually (but not necessarily) the case that the request
 * coordinate system has encoders. In this case, that readout coordinate
 * system is the first, and is called "request".
 *
 * States:
 * ======
 *
 * This interface exposes a state structure to which the servo system
 * implementation must conform (at least as seen through the interface).
 * Valid state transitions are detailed in the documentation below.
 *
 * The state structure helps to get around the inherently single threaded
 * nature of RPC. None of the procedures defined here block waiting
 * for servo system movement. All procedures return immediately after
 * their parameters have been checked (eg, that track request points are
 * monotonically increasing in time) and all required return information
 * has been gathered.
 *
 * Dead Zones:
 * ==========
 *
 * The antenna servo system coordinate space can contain any number of
 * dead zones. These are a static property of the servo system and
 * represent no-go areas of the coordinate space of the servo (not
 * necessarily expressed in the request coordinate system).
 *
 * The server communicates information about the dead zones of the
 * servo system so that higher levels of the control system can not
 * only determine the places on the sky where it should not send the
 * antenna, but can determine the amount of time before a dead zone
 * is entered (eg, the horizon).
 *
 * In this version of the interface, only one dead zone specification
 * "shape" is defined in this interface (a circle), but there is
 * provision for future expansion. For example, an irregular horizon
 * could be defined by a series of arbitrary points.
 *
 * Track Request and Track Readout Queues:
 * ======================================
 *
 * The servo implementation maintains a queue of request points called
 * the "track request queue". Each element of the queue consists of a
 * time, a request point, a maximum error for the point, and a number
 * of flags. Elements can be added to the track request queue via the
 * TRACK and TRACK_SHORT procedures. Times in the track request queue
 * must be monotonically increasing (the earliest time being at
 * the head of the queue), except for guard points.
 *
 * Another queue, called the "track readout queue", is also maintained
 * by the servo implementation. Each element of the track reply queue
 * consists of a timestamp, a set of readout points (one for each
 * readout coordinate system), and a flags word. The track readout
 * queue is accessed via the GET_TRACK procedure.
 *
 * The relationship between the track request queue and track readout
 * queue is that when the time indicated in the head element of the
 * track request queue arrives, the position of the antenna is
 * determined from the encoders, and an element is added to the track
 * reply queue. The timestamp for the element is the time from the
 * track request queue. The readout points are those obtained from
 * the encoders, and the flags are constructed according to the flag
 * descriptions.
 *
 * The exception to this sequence of events is if the FLAG_NO_REPLY
 * is specified in the track request queue element, in which case
 * the element is possibly discarded when its time comes due, in
 * accordance with the description of the FLAG_NO_REPLY flag.
 *
 * Some procedures and states clear the track request queue. This means
 * that any elements that are in the track request queue are transferred
 * to the track readout queue, which the cancelled flag set (unless the
 * FLAG_NO_REPLY flag is set, in which case the element is discarded).
 *
 * Target Point and Target Time:
 * ============================
 *
 * The "target point" and "target time" are the point and time
 * contained in the head element of the track request queue. The
 * significance of these two values is that when the servo system
 * is in the "tracking" state, the antenna is moving at a rate
 * (according to the currently selected interpolation scheme) in each
 * axis such that it will arrive at the target point exactly at the
 * target time. If it cannot make the target point at the target time
 * (because it is too far away from the current posision), then the
 * antenna is in the "slewing" state and it moves towards the target
 * point at the maximum drive rate.
 *
 * If the track request queue becomes empty, then the servo system
 * changes to the "idle" state and stops antenna movement.
 *
 * Interpolation Schemes:
 * =====================
 *
 * The servo implementation can support one or more interpolation
 * schemes. It reports the set or supported interpolation schemes from
 * a set of possible schemes, then one is slected for use. The
 * possible interpolation schemes are:
 *
 * linear:
 * ------
 * Linear interpolation in each axis.
 *
 * smooth:
 * ------
 * For each axis, calcaulate the slope at each point by fitting a
 * 4th order polynomial to the point and its neighbours two deep on
 * either side. To interpolate between any two points, fit a 3rd
 * order polynomial to the two points either side, and the
 * calculated slope at each of those points.
 *
 * Pointing Model:
 * ==============
 *
 * The pointing model is very antenna specific, and any attempt to
 * define an antenna independent pointing model would be difficult to
 * do and probably not of much long term use anyway. This interface
 * assumes that the pointing model is defined outside the normal interface
 * (e.g. via named values).
 *
 * Watchdog:
 * ========
 *
 * The server maintains a watchdog timeout value. If this timeout
 * period passes without any procedures being called (including the
 * PING procedure), then the servo system internally generates a STOW
 * procedure call. The watchdog timeout value can be set and queried
 * via the API. Its initial value is obtained externally (eg, from
 * the registry).
 *
 * Token:
 * =====
 *
 * This interface specifies for active methods (i.e. methods changing the
 * state of telescope and/or servo system) a 32-bit token to limit
 * access.
 *
 * Named Values:
 * ============
 *
 * The named values mechanism gives this interface an antenna dependent
 * component. The servo implementation maintains a list of strongly
 * typed name/value pairs, which can be retrieved and (optionally,
 * under control of the servo implementation) set via this interface.
 * The list of names is not documented in this interface, and is only
 * available at runtime.
