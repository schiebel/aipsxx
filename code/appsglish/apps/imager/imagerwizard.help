\begin{ahfunction}{imagerwizard}{Wizard for synthesis imaging}
\ahinclude{imagerwizard.g}

\begin{ahdescription} 

{\tt imagerwizard} provides a GUI for making a clean image from a
MeasurementSet with the minimum of user intervention.  It is based on
the \ahlink{table}{table}, \ahlink{imager}{imager}, \ahlink{ms}{ms},
and \ahlink{wizard}{wizard} Display is performed using the
\ahlink{viewer}{viewer:viewer}.

In imagerwizard, the user is walked through a number of steps
using a simple GUI:

\begin{itemize}
\item Either a MeasurementSet or a FITS file can be specified.
If the latter, it is converted to a MeasurementSet using 
the \ahlink{fitstoms}{ms:ms.fitstoms} constructor of the
\ahlink{ms}{ms} tool.
\item The spectral windows are listed and the user asked to
select one for imaging.
\item The user is asked to select values for certain control
values. Note that all of these can be left as the default
values ({\em i.e.} mostly unset values).
\item A clean image of the entire primary beam is made from the 
inner 33\% of the uv plane using 1000 Clean iterations.
\item The resulting clean image is displayed and the user
asked to zoom the region of interest.
\item The Clean is repeated at full resolution with all the data,
cleaned down to 3 $\sigma$ where the noise is estimated as
three times the Stokes V rms.
\item The final image is displayed.
\end{itemize}

Typically, imagerwizard works well for a quick look at all synthesis
data except VLBI but you may want to use \ahlink{imager}{imager}
directly for the final image.

During the cleaning stage, some of the relevant Glish commands for
\ahlink{imager}{imager} and the other tools are displayed. Note 
that these are slightly more verbose than you would type but should be
executable. Not all commands are displayed, obviously. In particular,
we have not shown those related to the operation of imagerwizard.
Hence all the command you see are ones that you might plausibly
use during data reduction.  The commands are written to a file
called 'imagerwizard\_commands.g' in the current directory.

Note that if you don't have a dataset, then the function
\ahlink{imagermaketestms()}{imager:imagermaketestms} can be used to
make a copy of the standard test MeasurementSet 3C273XC1.ms.
The button {\em Make test MS} (in stage 1) will accomplish the same thing.
