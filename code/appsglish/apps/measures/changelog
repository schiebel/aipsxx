Added multi-valued quantities to measures
 </summary>
 <description>
The measures tool can now create and operate on measures that have multi-valued scalar quantities (vector ('r_array') of quantities was already handled).
I.e. the following code will know what to do:

a:=dm.direction('j2000', dq.quantity([1,2],'deg'), dq.quantity([3,4],'deg'))
b:=dm.measure(a, 'B1950')
dm.getvalue(b)[1]

In cases where more than one value has to be given (e.g. a position needs two angles and a distance; or three distances), each multi-valued value given has to have the same number of values in it.
