todo list for the glishtk tablebrowser
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* highlight cell not complete until too late (8 mar 96)
  see the keywords in 'sample' table, 2nd field is an array of length 1000.
  selecting this field results in a lengthy delay as the array browser
  comes up, and only after that is the cell in the kwb displayed as 
  selected. from kwb.g:

    highlightKwbCell (kwbGui, column, row);

    fieldName := field_names (kwbGui.keywords) [row];
    fieldValue := kwbGui.keywords [fieldName];

    if (len (fieldValue) > 1) { # it is an array 
      junk := arrayBrowser (fieldValue, fieldName);
      }
    else if (tableExists (fieldValue)) {
      junk := browse (fieldValue)
      }
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* need busy cursor (8 mar 96)
  to indicate when something is happening, and the user must wait
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* give darrell example of failed cache signal (8 mar 96)
  filling in the frame with red does not actually show up, because
  it is apparently overwhelmed by other (glish?) events.
  
  if the cache is filled from gtable client data, which takes longer
  than getting it locally, then apparently the glish events subside,
  and the tk events are processed.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* get more discrimination in scrollbar drag events (8 mar 96)
  so that dragstart, drag, and dragend can be distinguished.
  this may be as simple as thumb-down, thumb-motion, thumb-up.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* dragthumb should scroll only the row numbers (8 mar 96)
  and the canvas should be updated only when the thumb is released.
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* gtablebrowser should get table name (names?), pass to glishtk (11 mar 96)
  glishtk doesn't yet accept command line arguments in this argv sense
*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
