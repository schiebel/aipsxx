Upgraded editing capabilities in pgplotter
 </summary>
 <description>

The editing capabilities have been upgraded to use the 
autogui. This means that the form of the editing gui
looks more familar and also that the usual capabilities
like cut and paste are supported. I've removed the
distinction between the guis for adding and changing
commands since this seems unnatural to many testers.
(We'll see if this is any better!)
